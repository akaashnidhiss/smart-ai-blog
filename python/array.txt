"President Biden's $2 trillion [American Jobs Plan infrastructure proposal](https://www.vox.com/2021/3/31/22357179/biden-two-trillion-infrastructure-jobs-plan-explained) used a broader definition of infrastructure than most people tend to associate with the word. It took on everything from roads, pipes, and electricity to climate change, union jobs, and inequality.\r\n\r\nIt also provided $100 billion to America's digital infrastructure, with a lofty goal of giving all Americans access to the affordable, reliable high-speed internet they need to participate in today's economy. The plan is short on specifics for now, but the vast majority of that money will go to building out high-speed broadband connections to the millions of Americans who still don't have them. There are also provisions about promoting competition and lowering prices. Biden called broadband internet \"the new electricity,\" comparing the need for a federal initiative to bring it to all Americans to the [Rural Electrification Act of 1936](https://livingnewdeal.org/glossary/rural-electrification-act-1936/).\r\n\r\nIf you've been paying attention, Biden's focus on closing the digital divide shouldn't be a surprise. He called for \"universal broadband\" during his campaign in his [Build Back Better plan](https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/). He [appointed](https://www.vox.com/recode/21557495/biden-fcc-digital-divide-net-neutrality-section-230) Jessica Rosenworcel, who as an FCC commissioner has been championing affordable broadband internet for years, to be acting chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\r\n\r\nRosenworcel's response to Biden's plan, by the way? \"I'm all in.\"\r\n\r\nBut it's also an [enormous and complicated undertaking](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/9/10/21426810/internet-access-covid-19-chattanooga-municipal-broadband-fcc) that America has been trying to accomplish for years, under three (now four) presidencies. The exact number of Americans who [don't have access](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/4/9/21214105/coronavirus-internet-rural-america) to broadband infrastructure varies depending on several factors, including the maps you use to count them and what your definition of reliable high-speed internet is. Biden put the number at 30 million. And that number doesn't include the millions of Americans who do have access to broadband internet but can't afford it, rendering that access meaningless.\r\n\r\nThe affordability issue has become all the more obvious and problematic during the pandemic. Lawmakers had to [scramble](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/12/23/22196354/stimulus-bill-broadband-internet) to help lower-income people gain internet access through various subsidies and stimulus bills, while the FCC [essentially had to beg](https://www.fcc.gov/keep-americans-connected) internet service providers not to cut off Americans if they couldn't afford their internet bills. Those aren't permanent solutions, though, and they still weren't enough for some. Biden's plan wants to help those people, too.\r\n\r\n\"When I say affordable, I mean it,\" Biden said in a speech announcing the plan. \"Americans pay too much.\"\r\n\r\nAdvocates for universal broadband access and affordability have lauded the plan.\r\n\r\n\"It's an earnest effort to attain digital equity for all Americans, address overpriced internet service, and implement greater transparency and accountability,\" Willmary Escoto of digital rights nonprofit Access Now told Recode. \"The American Jobs Plan advances the US into a new digital future, one where every individual in America has a fair shot at success.\"\r\n\r\nGigi Sohn, a distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Institute for Technology Law & Policy, [said in a statement](http://gigisohn.com/media/sohn-lauds-president-bidens-big-bet-on-broadband/) that Biden's plan was notable not only in its ambition but also in \"the message it sends --- that broadband, like electricity, is a necessity, and that one cannot participate in our economy, our education and health care systems and our society without it ... The United States cannot afford to be a country of digital haves and have-nots.\"\r\n\r\n\"President Biden's $100 billion infrastructure plan acknowledges an important fact about broadband today --- it is an essential service, like water and electricity, and our public policy should reflect that fact,\" Greg Guice, government affairs director at open internet advocacy group Public Knowledge, [said in a statement](https://www.publicknowledge.org/press-release/public-knowledge-hails-president-biden-for-100-billion-dollar-bid-to-make-broadband-available-and-affordable-for-all/). \"We look forward to working with the administration and members of Congress as they seek to pass this bold initiative to close the digital divide.\"\r\n\r\nThe [fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/) the Biden administration released doesn't go into the details beyond saying how much money Biden wants to invest and, generally, what he hopes the return on that investment will be: high-speed, \"future-proof\" broadband access covering the entire country; more competition between providers, including municipally owned plans and co-ops; and reduced costs.\r\n\r\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) [said](https://twitter.com/SenAmyKlobuchar/status/1377401811531927559) that the Biden plan was based on the Accessible, Affordable Internet for All Act, which she and Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) introduced in their respective houses last year and [reintroduced](https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=C3C8F0E4-61D4-46FE-A28A-F81A09620A5D) last month.\r\n\r\nThat bill gives $80 billion to broadband infrastructure, requires service providers who use networks built on that infrastructure to offer affordable service plans, and provides an additional $6 billion to the Emergency Broadband Benefit program. It will also make it easier for local governments, public-private partnerships, and cooperatives to set up their own networks that could compete with traditional for-profit service providers --- which, in many areas, remain consumers' only real option.\r\n\r\n\"The coronavirus pandemic exposed and exacerbated many longstanding faults that must be repaired if America is to retain her greatness,\" Clyburn told Recode. \"In addition to repairing many of our nation's faults, the American Jobs Plan wisely guards against the emergence of additional faults in the future.\"\r\n\r\nAnna Read, a senior research officer with the broadband access initiative at the Pew Charitable Trusts, told Recode that the federal government should [look to](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2021/03/02/what-policymakers-can-learn-from-the-minnesota-model-of-broadband-expansion) [state](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2021/03/24/virginia-aims-for-universal-broadband-access-by-2028) and local broadband access programs, which Read believes [will be the key](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/news-room/opinion/2020/12/16/a-national-solution-to-the-digital-divide-starts-with-states) to implementing Biden's vision.\r\n\r\n\"States have really been leading on this issue over the last few years,\" Read said. \"They've been investing significant state dollars and expanding broadband access. ... Increasingly, states are beginning to look at the affordability question as well.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Biden plan promises a lot, delivering it will be a different matter. Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump all [had lofty goals](https://link.wired.com/view/5c927d2a3f92a40ad9bb692ddxo4h.2tez/47aae4c2) about connecting America. None of them delivered, and millions of Americans paid the price for that failure when the pandemic laid bare just how far behind America is.\r\n\r\nScott Wallsten, president and senior fellow at the Technology Policy Institute, said there are too many unknowns at this point to say whether Biden's plan will be the one that reverses that trend. After all, if getting everyone in America online were easy, it would have been done already. He hopes that the plan provides for experimentation and analysis to see where and why people aren't getting online, rather than just throwing money at a problem and assuming that will solve it. He sees a lot of places where this could go wrong or be wasteful, but he said there's reason to be optimistic, too.\r\n\r\n\"What I think is good is that people are actually paying attention to the digital divide and its consequences in a way that they never were before,\" Wallsten said. \"We see the problems and the inequities and what can happen as a result ... I think, for once, those people actually really are visible.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a significant infrastructure challenge but it is also an affordability challenge,\" Read said. \"Addressing the two in tandem will be very important to closing the digital divide.\"",/n"When I started my ***Web-Development*** journey, getting overwhelmed by so many topics is what I used to face all the time, there is always something new that I have to learn while having no idea about what I should learn. I can assure you must have faced this issue if you are getting started in ***Programming*** or ***Web*-*Development,*** so I decided to prepare a roadmap for beginners who are looking to get into Web-Development, from my own experience I can assure, it gets harder if you have undecided goals about what you need to build with your skills, so make sure you always have a proper goal about where you want to apply these skills, otherwise, the learning path never ends for a developer.\r\n\r\nHow The Internet Works\r\n======================\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*H6TRigK5R6AbKx3UC8TuRw.png?q=20)\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1628/1*H6TRigK5R6AbKx3UC8TuRw.png)\r\n\r\nYou don't have to get into the deeper concepts of the internet to become a Web-Developer, all you need is a basic knowledge of how things work under the hood to make your learning path more practical. Otherwise, you will be writing code with no idea about how is it going to perform in your application.\r\n\r\nYou can think of the internet as pair of computers, running 24*7 to provide services, any kind of web-application or website has to access a server or a memory where the files are stored related to that application.\r\n\r\n> Note: There are many other terms that you should learn such as **Ip Address, Gateways, Cookies, etc.**\r\n\r\n-   **HTTP/HTTPS:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the main method through which the data of web pages are transferred over a network. As the web pages are stored on servers, which are then served to the client computer as the user accesses them. But there is an issue with ***HTTP*** being less secure which easily gives access to third-party attackers stealing the data. Due to this security issue, later after ***HTTPS*** was introduced. In the case of HTTPS, it requires a secure certificate from a third-party vendor to secure the connection and verify if that site is secure. This secure certificate is called ***SSL (Secure Socket Layer),* **it simply adds an extra layer of security for sensitive data that we don't want someone to access easily (most of the time third-party attackers).\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*tGytsttOqyWasdEXlR6wgg.png?q=20)\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1965/1*tGytsttOqyWasdEXlR6wgg.png)\r\n\r\n-   **DNS:** Among web-developers, DNS is one of the least understood concepts of the internet, DNS is quite important to understand for Web-Developers as it is the glue that links your domain name ***(yourwebsite.com)*** to your website which is hosted on the internet & it stands for **Domain Name Service.**\r\n\r\n> **I**n simple words we are talking about the ability for users who are browsing the internet at your web address to be directed to the **IP Address** of the server that is hosting your website.\r\n\r\n-   **Hosting:** Web hosting is the process of providing a space, where all the content of your website has to be housed on a server so that anyone can access it all over the world. You don't have to deep dive into the concepts of hosting these days, as there is plenty number of platforms where you can host a website within a few steps.\r\n-   **Browsers:** As a web-developer, you should know how browsers work with a web application, having a good knowledge of browsers unlocks more ways to optimize your applications, which results in more reliable applications so that users on various browsers can have the best possible results.\r\n-   **Domain Names:** You can call it a web address to your website, so anytime a user enters that address in their browsers they will be redirected to your website. If you want to read more concepts of how Domain Names work, here is an awesome [***article***](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/beginners-guide-what-is-a-domain-name-and-how-do-domains-work/) for that.\r\n\r\nBasic Tools\r\n===========\r\n\r\n1\\. Terminal\r\n------------\r\n\r\nEvery developer should master the ecosystem of terminals tools, when I started programming the biggest problem that I used to face is having no idea what to do with the terminal, so if you are getting started into web-development it is highly recommended to learn how the terminal works on different machines.\r\n\r\nOn **macOS** and **Linux**-based machines, we have the **bash** terminal, which is the most loved terminal among developers yet as it serves the best package of tools with no compatibility issues, and if you have **Windows OS** on your machine then also you can access that workspace of UNIX through **WSL2 (Windows Subsystem For Linux)**, using WSL2 you can virtually use a **UNIX** based environment in your machine and get the work done most effectively.\r\n\r\n> ***From my own personal experience, you will be having a lot of issues in the case of the Windows OS terminal, as there are some tools that doesn't support in Windows OS terminal, so I highly recommend you to install a WSL environment before getting started.***\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*hNztAAf5PHeOyX-_qNCPYA.png?q=20)\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1990/1*hNztAAf5PHeOyX-_qNCPYA.png)\r\n\r\n**My WSL2 Environment**\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of advantages if you use a WSL environment, as you can install tools such as **zsh** and the **autocomplete** plugins.\r\n\r\n-   **Bash:** You will find bash as your most useful terminal, as it's highly customizable and supports awesome plugins, most of the time you will find it hard to work without UNIX commands if you are not using a bash terminal.\r\n-   **Git Bash:** Quite frankly I don't use the Git bash as much, but that's a whole matter of preference, Git bash provides a UNIX-based environment on Windows OS machines when we install Git.\r\n\r\n2\\. Desing Tools\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n-   **Figma & Adobe XD:** You will be using a lot of design tools to make wireframes or just to build a preview of your applications, Figma & Adobe XD both work pretty well, but it's recommended to use ***Figma*** as you can access it on any device & and all of your files are stored on the cloud, so you don't have to worry about the files and changes that you made.\r\n\r\n3\\. Text Editors\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*dWEemxZZwShrqfAD8RibvA.png?q=20)\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1836/1*dWEemxZZwShrqfAD8RibvA.png)\r\n\r\nThere nothing much you need to know about text editors before getting started, as all the tools and plugins that you need are just a part of your learning path, also there is no need to get familiar with any deep stuff about text editors, the most loved text editor **VS Code** is recommended from my side as it offers the best tools & its very lightweight. But text editors such as **Atom** & **Sublime Text** have special support for web development, you can choose any of the 3 text editors but make sure that you stick to only one until you are familiar enough with **IDEs**.\r\n\r\nHTML\r\n====\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*ftWMCayzB_R3dHBw.jpg?q=20)\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/0*ftWMCayzB_R3dHBw.jpg)\r\n\r\nLearning the root of any skills is most important in programming, if you have no idea bout HTML and how its shapes web application then it will be just as similar to working with doubts, also you don't have to completely master HTML to be a web developer but that's a skill that you should know as a web developer. Learn the basic of HTML and the following concepts :\r\n\r\n-   **Forms & Validations:** These days we don't use core HTML for forms with validations in our applications, there is plenty number of external libraries built by developers & where we can build beautiful forms with validation within few steps and much lesser lines of code. But in case our application is very lightweight to use, we should learn HTML forms & validations.\r\n-   **Semantic HTML:** The part of HTML that introduces the meaning of the web page rather than just representation. ***For example,*** we have a **<p>** tag which indicated that the enclosed text is a paragraph. The benefit of writing semantic HTML is that it provides a driving goal for a web page & it gives you many more hooks for styling your content.\r\n-   **Best Practices:** When you are done with the basics of HTML, make sure to apply some rules in your code such as using a meaningful title ***tag***, and always declaring a ***doctype***. Following these practices makes you a better developer who can manage projects better than anyone.\r\n\r\nCSS\r\n===\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*zB2CszpaE-b0xBL6.jpg?q=20)\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2250/0*zB2CszpaE-b0xBL6.jpg)\r\n\r\n1\\. CSS Basics\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n-   **CSS Grid:** It is a layout system in CSS that allows you to quickly create flexible two-dimensional layouts, it is not a framework or a library, you can use it to ***place, size, align*** layouts easily that were quite hard without CSS Grid when we have only **floats** and **flexbox**. CSS Grid is highly recommended to learn as a beginner if you are more focused on front-end development.\r\n-   **Flexbox:** A layout mode in ***CSS3***, it is used to make the elements behave responsibly when they are used with different screen sizes, flexbox are almost everywhere in modern web applications they are more capable of handling changes when the application behaves in different manners. You can think of a flexbox as a container where you can render any kind of data that is valid inside the flexbox and using various flex properties you can manage the position of these containers.\r\n-   **Custom Properties:** Also called CSS variables, they are entities defined by CSS authors that contain some specific values to be reused throughout the document. The advantage of using custom properties in CSS is that you can make more complex front-end applications with clean code.\r\n\r\n> ***For example,*** *lets say you have a complex web application to build, and if your UI contains some specific number of colours then you have to define them everywhere in your code, instead of that we can use custom CSS properties where we can store there value globaly and use them anywhere.*\r\n\r\n2\\. Modern CSS\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nOnce you are done with basic **CSS & HTML** I would highly recommend building some web pages that force you to learn **HTML & CSS** in your own way.\r\n\r\n> Always work with smaller projects so that you don't have to worry about learning the root concepts through your learning path.\r\n\r\n-   **CSS Modules:** CSS module is not an official implementation in the border but rather a process in a build step that changes class names and selectors to be scoped.\r\n\r\n***For example:* **The way CSS & HTML normally work is when a class is applied in HTML, as we have to apply CSS to the HTML document and the background color of **<h1>** would be **red**, this approach becomes a bit harder to maintain in case of huge web applications, but if you are using CSS modules instead of writing plain HTML, we need to write all of our markup in a **JavaScript** file, such as **index.js.**\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*OSOyk6RGbRVBErOiBJWj-A.png?q=20)\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2273/1*OSOyk6RGbRVBErOiBJWj-A.png)\r\n\r\n-   **Styled Components:** One of the new ways to work with CSS is styled-components in modern **JavaScript**, you can call it a successor of CSS modules where you write CSS that's *scoped to a single component* instead of leaking to any other element on the page. I would recommend learning styled-components only if you are comfortable enough to work with CSS without any weak concepts.\r\n\r\n3\\. CSS Frameworks\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n> They provide a basic structure for designing consistent solutions instead of working from scratch\r\n\r\n-   **Bootstrap:** Among all the CSS frameworks Bootstrap gives the most promising architecture with enough customization options. Still widely popular among **WordPress** and **Drupal** users. There are plenty of reasons to choose Bootstrap rather than any CSS framework, especially if you are a beginner who has to work with frontend skills then Bootstrap is easy to learn as it offers fewer files for those who know how to work a bit with CSS and also provides the plain old CSS for who don't want to use CSS pre-processing.\r\n-   **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind is a bit different from other frameworks as it doesn't have a default theme& there are no built-in UI components. If you are looking for a framework that comes with a predesigned widget to build applications then it might not be the right choice for you. I still personally prefer using ***Bootstrap*** as it provides a more easy way to build beautiful applications.\r\n\r\n4\\. Responsive Design\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nAs a developer one of the biggest issues is building a responsive user interface, as there are different screen sizes where your applications are going to be used, to solve this issue, there is a term called **Responsive Desing** which focuses on building user interfaces that perform flexibly on all screen sizes.\r\n\r\n> ***To build a responsive web application you have kept the following three terms in mind:***\r\n\r\n-   **CSS Media Queries:** They give you a way to apply CSS only when the browser and device environment matches a rule that you can specify. For example, ***a viewport is wider than 500 pixels,*** media queries are a key part of responsive web design, also they can be used to detect other things about the environment of your application. All you need to get started with CSS media queries is basic ***HTML* **and** *CSS.***\r\n-   **Viewport:** The visible area of web pages known as the viewport, back then when the web is only used on the computer the web pages were designed to have a fixed size, but later after that when we started using the web on mobile devices, developers started using viewports in web pages to make them behave more responsibly.\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*VLg5J-3B1WMwz7-uOPwiKw.png?q=20)\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1199/1*VLg5J-3B1WMwz7-uOPwiKw.png)\r\n\r\n-   **rem units:**\r\n\r\n> According to the **W3C** spec rems units are the computed value of font-size on the root element, when specified on the font-size property of the root element, the rem units refer to the property's initial value.\r\n\r\n5\\. CSS Preprocessors\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n> They compile the code that is written using a special compiler, then they use that to create a CSS file that can be referenced by the main HTML document.\r\n\r\n-   **Sass:** One of the widely used CSS preprocessors, **Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets,** using *Sass* you can write your own code in CSS that will be faster and easier to maintain. ***For example,* **normally you must have used **hex** values for different colors with a lot of variations, so instead of typing those ***hex values*** you can just simply use Sass to store those values with a particular name, and later after that, you can use them anywhere in your build.\r\n-   **PostCSS:** A great alternative for CSS preprocessors, PostCSS is more focused on working with a blank state with many options according to your needs. I personally find ***PostCSS*** easier to work with as it is easier to set up and provides much extensibility.\r\n\r\n6\\. Animations\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n-   **Plain CSS:** Before you dive into CSS animation libraries, it's better to learn basic CSS animation skills, such as defining keyframes for the animation. (***keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times)***. Learning these skills won't take much time as at this time you are pretty much familiar with CSS properties.\r\n-   **GSAP:** The GreenSock Animation Platform is one of the popular **JavaScript** tools for building animations on the web, whether you build responsive web apps, games: GSPA is always up to the task. Also, it is very beginner-friendly and delivers the control that professionals need which is the reason why it is used on over 8 million sites.\r\n-   **anime.js:** You will always find new animation libraries during your learning path, so instead of focusing on new tools and libraries work with the easy-to-use alternatives that deliver promising results. *anime.js* has been one of my favorites because of the compact structure with an elegant approach.\r\n\r\nFront-End Developer Path\r\n========================\r\n\r\n1\\. Learn JavaScript\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nHaving a good and proper knowledge of the JavaScript concepts is a key to become a better front-end developer, if you are new to any programming language then start with:\r\n\r\n-   **The basic syntax of JavaScript**\r\n-   **JSON**\r\n-   **ES6/ES7**\r\n-   **TypeScript**\r\n-   **Fetch API**\r\n\r\nand if you have some experience with any ***OOP*** programming language then you should focus on some best practices and tools to boost your JavaScript skills such as:\r\n\r\n-   **Axios**\r\n-   **Dev Tools**\r\n-   **ESLint**\r\n-   **VS Code Extensions**\r\n-   **npm scripts**\r\n-   **Version Control Systems (Git)**\r\n-   **Package managers (npm or yarn)**\r\n\r\n2\\. Choose The Right Front-End Framework\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-   **React:** You can't call React a web framework because when we build the application with a framework such as Angular and Vue our application structure is very defined and you can simply notice these structures in an Angular or Vue application but in the case of React which a JavaScript library to build UI components, its doesn't force you to follow that pattern for building applications, and that's the reason React is most loved by developers, the flexibility that you get with React is better than any web framework.\r\n-   **Angular:** The learning curve in Angular is pretty different and it is a fully-fledged framework, so if you want deep dive into concepts like **TypeScript** ***MVC pattern, directives, modules, decorators, services, pipes*** & dependencies injection then only go after learning Angular\r\n-   **Vue:** It provides high customizability and that makes it easier to learn than any web framework, but Vue overlaps with Angular and React for their functionality such as the working of components. It will be quite easy for you to start building applications with ***Vue*** as simplicity and flexibility are some of its biggest advantages.\r\n\r\nBack-End Developer Path\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n1\\. Pick A Back-End Framework\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n-   **Node.js:** It hasbeen my personal choice for backend applications, it's a perfect choice for a JavaScript developer who has less experience with any kind of backend development, also Node.js perfectly fits in the **JavaScript** ecosystem which makes it one of the most loved choices by developers. Also, Node.js offers the most promising performance when it comes to fast and scalable applications, which is the reason why the tech giants are moving their backend stack to Node.js.\r\n-   **Deno.js:** The reason I'm adding Deno.js to this list is that there are plenty of good chances that Deno might win the backend battle in 2021, as it's been only a few years since it's released and already it's becoming the choice for fast backend applications, in comparison to any web technology Deno has been gaining the fastest popularity that I have observed.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Deno is not a fork of Node, we can call it a new implementation based on modern features of JavaScript, it's a secure runtime for **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** based on **Google's V8** just similar to Node.js, but the core is built using **Rust** in Deno, whereas its **C++** in case of Node.\r\n\r\n-   **Django:** If you like to add a bit more to your stack, then there is nothing better than Django, it is simple to use and much secure with great performance. I would personally recommend learning Django if you want to build applications that take less time while offering a good level of security, Django is much secure due to its built-in security system. Also, you can use the in-built templates that offer the same performance with no issues.\r\n-   **Flask:** There are many key differences in Flask, as Flask is a **WSGI** framework whereas Django is a** *full-stack web framework***. It completely depends on which approach you prefer, as Flask offers the **MVC** pattern and as a backend developer, you should stick to your preferences no matter if the framework is old or new. Flask is minimal yet powerful, but not the best choice you can make for backend applications in 2021.\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*8lCG4cqZrSVi8UG58m5nuQ.png?q=20)\r\n\r\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1784/1*8lCG4cqZrSVi8UG58m5nuQ.png)\r\n\r\n2\\. Databases\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n> Relational Databases VS Non-Relational Databases\r\n\r\n**Relational Databases** are mostly used in enterprise scenarios, they store information with **columns, rows,** and **tables**. Where each column is associated with a data point and a row represents the value for that category. In relational databases, each table can only store one object.\r\n\r\n-   **MySQL**\r\n-   **PostgreSQL**\r\n\r\n> **For example**, you can't store data on customers and clients in the same relational table. To make that work you will need two tables: one for customers, another one for clients.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of **Non-Relational Databases**, which are more flexible because the data isn't limited to the same table, they use columns and rows to enter types of data and its values and identify objects with keys. Here we can identify the object with a key and assign data to it, now anytime you need to assign some new data to the object, you just have to enter a specific key, without looking and editing a particular table.\r\n\r\n-   **MongoDB** -Recommended\r\n-   **AWS**- Easy to scale\r\n-   **Firebase**- A great choice for small projects\r\n\r\n3\\. APIs\r\n--------\r\n\r\nNow when you are done with databases you need to access the data on the frontend through APIs, think about the electricity supply in your houses, to use an appliance you need to plug it into a plug socket. Similarly, we use a written API in a higher-level language such as **JavaScript** or **Python.** As a beginner, you should learn how different APIs work and where you can use them to minimize work in your projects.\r\n\r\n-   **Authentication:** Nowadays almost all web application has to work with several users, and to keep a track on users you need to implement authentication. The most stable way you can go for is working with **OAuth** or **JavaScript Web Tokens (JWT),** and if you want to take it a bit easy there are some good alternatives such as **Auth0** or **Firebase.**\r\n\r\nDeployment\r\n==========\r\n\r\nConcepts to Learn\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n-   **Load Balancing:** The process of distributing workloads across multiple servers, where the main purpose of load balancing is to prevent any single server from getting overloaded. You can't build scalable applications without applying load balancers.\r\n-   **GitHub Actions:** They enable you to create custom software development cycle workflows in your GitHub repository, and these workflows are made out of different tasks knows as actions that can be run automatically on certain events.\r\n-   **SSH:** Stands for ***Secure Socket Shell,*** a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network, SSH provides a strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an open network.\r\n-   **Monitoring:** A web application that handles a lot of user interaction always requires monitoring to make sure that the application is performing at its peaks. One of the main goals of monitoring is to achieve high availability by minimizing time to detect & the time to mitigate.\r\n-   **SSL Certificates:** They enable websites to move from **HTTP** to **more secure HTTPS**. The SSL certificate is a data file hosted in a website's origin server and they contain website public key along with other related information.\r\n\r\nServerless (FaaS)\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe concept of serverless computing via serverless architecture, developers use this to deploy an individual function or a piece of logic which they want to start within milliseconds and process individual requests. One of the best options for computing services are listed below:\r\n\r\n-   **AWS Lambda**\r\n-   **Netlify**\r\n\r\nVirtualization\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nUsing Virtualization you can create powerful IT services that require traditional connections to hardware, which allows you to use a physical machine at its full capacity by distributing its capability to many users.\r\n\r\nYou can use **Kubernetes** and **Docker**, the basic difference between these are is that Kubernetes run across ***clusters*** while Docker runs on a ***single node***. Most of the developers prefer using both of them together to build better infrastructure.",/n"**Data Mining**: Data mining in general terms means mining or digging deep into data which is in different forms to gain patterns, and to gain knowledge on that pattern. In the process of data mining, large data sets are first sorted, then patterns are identified and relationships are established to perform data analysis and solve problems.\\\r\n**Classification**: It is a Data analysis task, i.e. the process of finding a model that describes and distinguishes data classes and concepts. Classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (subpopulations), a new observation belongs to, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations and whose categories membership is known.\\\r\n**Example**: Before starting any Project, we need to check it's feasibility. In this case, a classifier is required to predict class labels such as 'Safe' and 'Risky' for adopting the Project and to further approve it. It is a two-step process such as :\r\n\r\n1.  **Learning Step (Training Phase)**: Construction of Classification Model\\\r\n    Different Algorithms are used to build a classifier by making the model learn using the training set available. The model has to be trained for the prediction of accurate results.\r\n2.  **Classification Step**: Model used to predict class labels and testing the constructed model on test data and hence estimate the accuracy of the classification rules.\r\n\r\n**Training and Testing:**\\\r\nSuppose there is a person who is sitting under a fan and the fan starts falling on him, he should get aside in order not to get hurt. So, this is his training part to move away. While Testing if the person sees any heavy object coming towards him or falling on him and moves aside then the system is tested positively and if the person does not move aside then the system is negatively tested.\\\r\nSame is the case with the data, it should be trained in order to get the accurate and best results.\r\n\r\nThere are certain data types associated with data mining that actually tells us the format of the file (whether it is in text format or in numerical format).\\\r\nAttributes -- Represents different features of an object. Different types of attributes are:\r\n\r\n1.  **Binary**: Possesses only two values i.e. True or False\\\r\n    Example: Suppose there is a survey of evaluating some product. We need to check whether it's useful or not. So, the Customer has to answer it in Yes or No.\\\r\n    Product usefulness: Yes / No\r\n    -   **Symmetric**: Both values are equally important in all aspects\r\n    -   **Asymmetric**: When both the values may not be important.\r\n2.  **Nominal**: When more than two outcomes are possible. It is in Alphabet form rather than being in Integer form.\\\r\n    **Example**: One needs to choose some material but of different colors. So, the color might be Yellow, Green, Black, Red.\\\r\n    Different Colors: Red, Green, Black, Yellow\r\n    -   **Ordinal**: Values that must have some meaningful order.\\\r\n        Example: Suppose there are grade sheets of few students which might contain different grades as per their performance such as A, B, C, D\\\r\n        Grades: A, B, C, D\r\n    -   **Continuous**: May have infinite number of values, it is in float type\\\r\n        Example: Measuring weight of few Students in a sequence or orderly manner i.e. 50, 51, 52, 53\\\r\n        Weight: 50, 51, 52, 53\r\n    -   **Discrete**: Finite number of values.\\\r\n        Example: Marks of a Student in a few subjects: 65, 70, 75, 80, 90\\\r\n        Marks: 65, 70, 75, 80, 90\r\n\r\n**Syntax:**\r\n\r\n-   Mathematical Notation: Classification is based on building a function taking input feature vector \"X\" and predicting its outcome \"Y\" (Qualitative response taking values in set C)\r\n-   Here Classifier (or model) is used which is a Supervised function, can be designed manually based on expert's knowledge. It has been constructed to predict class labels (Example: Label -- \"Yes\" or \"No\" for the approval of some event).\r\n\r\nClassifiers can be categorized into two major types:\r\n\r\n1.  **Discriminative**: It is a very basic classifier and determines just one class for each row of data. It tries to model just by depending on the observed data, depends heavily on the quality of data rather than on distributions.\\\r\n    **Example**: Logistic Regression\\\r\n    Acceptance of a student at a University (Test and Grades need to be considered)\\\r\n    Suppose there are few students and the Result of them are as follows :\r\n\r\n    Student 1 : Test Score: 9/10, Grades: 8/10  Result: Accepted\r\n    Student 2 : Test Score: 3/10, Grades: 4/10, Result: Rejected\r\n    Student 3 : Test Score: 7/10, Grades: 6/10, Result: to be tested\r\n\r\n    ![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/123-4.png)\r\n\r\n2.  **Generative**: It models the distribution of individual classes and tries to learn the model that generates the data behind the scenes by estimating assumptions and distributions of the model. Used to predict the unseen data.\\\r\n    **Example**: Naive Bayes Classifier\\\r\n    Detecting Spam emails by looking at the previous data. Suppose 100 emails and that too divided in 1:4 i.e. Class A: 25%(Spam emails) and Class B: 75%(Non-Spam emails). Now if a user wants to check that if an email contains the word cheap, then that may be termed as Spam.\\\r\n    It seems to be that in Class A(i.e. in 25% of data), 20 out of 25 emails are spam and rest not.\\\r\n    And in Class B(i.e. in 75% of data), 70 out of 75 emails are not spam and rest are spam.\\\r\n    So, if the email contains the word cheap, what is the probability of it being spam ?? (= 80%)\r\n\r\n**Classifiers Of Machine Learning:**\r\n\r\n1.  Decision Trees\r\n2.  Bayesian Classifiers\r\n3.  Neural Networks\r\n4.  K-Nearest Neighbour\r\n5.  Support Vector Machines\r\n6.  Linear Regression\r\n7.  Logistic Regression<\r\n\r\n**Associated Tools and Languages:** Used to mine/ extract useful information from raw data.\r\n\r\n-   **Main Languages used**: R, SAS, Python, SQL\r\n-   **Major Tools used**: RapidMiner, Orange, KNIME, Spark, Weka\r\n-   **Libraries used**: Jupyter, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, ScikitLearn, NLTK, TensorFlow, Seaborn, Basemap, etc.\r\n\r\n**Real Life Examples :**\r\n\r\n-   **Market Basket Analysis:**\\\r\n    It is a modeling technique that has been associated with frequent transactions of buying some combination of items.\\\r\n    **Example**: Amazon and many other Retailers use this technique. While viewing some product, certain suggestions for the commodities are shown that some people have bought in the past.\r\n-   **Weather Forecasting:**\\\r\n    Changing Patterns in weather conditions needs to be observed based on parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind direction. This keen observation also requires the use of previous records in order to predict it accurately.\r\n\r\n**Advantages:**\r\n\r\n-   Mining Based Methods are cost effective and efficient\r\n-   Helps in identifying criminal suspects\r\n-   Helps in predicting risk of diseases\r\n-   Helps Banks and Financial Institutions to identify defaulters so that they may approve Cards, Loan, etc.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages:**\\\r\nPrivacy: When the data is either are chances that a company may give some information about their customers to other vendors or use this information for their profit.\\\r\nAccuracy Problem: Selection of Accurate model must be there in order to get the best accuracy and result.\r\n\r\n**APPLICATIONS:**\r\n\r\n-   Marketing and Retailing\r\n-   Manufacturing\r\n-   Telecommunication Industry\r\n-   Intrusion Detection\r\n-   Education System\r\n-   Fraud Detection\r\n\r\n**GIST OF DATA MINING :**\r\n\r\n1.  Choosing the correct classification method, like decision trees, Bayesian networks, or neural networks.\r\n2.  Need a sample of data, where all class values are known. Then the data will be divided into two parts, a training set, and a test set.\r\n\r\nNow, the training set is given to a learning algorithm, which derives a classifier. Then the classifier is tested with the test set, where all class values are hidden.\\\r\nIf the classifier classifies most cases in the test set correctly, it can be assumed that it works accurately also on the future data else it may be a wrong model chosen.",/n"**Web Application Framework** or simply \"web framework\" is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs.

Earlier, there were only few content creators in Web 1.0 with the huge majority of users who are consumers of content. Personal web pages were common, consisting mainly of static pages hosted on ISP-run web servers, or on free web hosting services.\r\n\r\nIn Web 1.0 advertisements on websites while surfing the internet is banned. Also, in Web 1.0, Ofoto is an online digital photography website, on which user could store, share, view and print digital pictures. Web 1.0 is a content delivery network (CDN) which enables to showcase the piece of information on the websites. It can be used as personal websites. It costs to user as per pages viewed. It has directories which enable user to retrieve a particular piece of information.\r\n\r\n**Four design essentials of a Web 1.0 site include:**\r\n2.  Static pages.\r\n3.  Content is served from the server's file-system.\r\n4.  Pages built using Server Side Includes or Common Gateway Interface (CGI).\r\n5.  Frames and Tables used to position and align the elements on a page.\r\n\r\n**Web 2.0 --**\\\r\nWeb 2.0 refers to world wide website which highlight user-generated content, usability and interoperability for end users. Web 2.0 is also called participative social web. It does not refer to a modification to any technical specification, but to modify in the way Web pages are designed and used. The transition is beneficial but it does not seem that when the changes are occurred. An interaction and collaboration with each other is allowed by Web 2.0 in a social media dialogue as creator of user-generated content in a virtual community. Web 1.0 is enhanced version of Web 2.0.\r\n\r\nThe web browser technologies are used in Web 2.0 development and it includes AJAX and JavaScript frameworks. Recently, AJAX and JavaScript frameworks have become a very popular means of creating web 2.0 sites.\r\n\r\n**Five major features of Web 2.0 --**\r\n2.  Free sorting of information, permits users to retrieve and classify the information collectively.\r\n3.  Dynamic content that is responsive to user input.\r\n4.  Information flows between site owner and site users by means of evaluation & online commenting.\r\n5.  Developed APIs to allow self-usage, such as by a software application.\r\n6.  Web access leads to concern different, from the traditional Internet user base to a wider variety of users.\r\n\r\n**Usage of Web 2.0 --**\r\n\r\n3.  Podcasting\r\n4.  Blogging\r\n5.  Tagging\r\n6.  Curating with RSS\r\n7.  Social bookmarking\r\n8.  Social networking\r\n9.  Social media\r\n10. Web content voting\r\n\r\n**Web 3.0 --**\\\r\nIt refers the evolution of web utilization and interaction which includes altering the Web into a database. In enables the upgradation of back-end of the web, after a long time of focus on the front-end (Web 2.0 has mainly been about AJAX, tagging, and another front-end user-experience innovation). Web 3.0 is a term which is used to describe many evolutions of web usage and interaction among several paths. In this, data isn't owned but instead shared, where services show different views for the same web / the same data.\r\n\r\nThe Semantic Web (3.0) promises to establish \"the world's information\" in more reasonable way than Google can ever attain with their existing engine schema. This is particularly true from the perspective of machine conception as opposed to human understanding. The Semantic Web necessitates the use of a declarative ontological language like OWL to produce domain-specific ontologies that machines can use to reason about information and make new conclusions, not simply match keywords.\r\n\r\n**Below are 5 main features that can help us define Web 3.0:**\r\n2.  **Semantic Web**\\\r\n    The succeeding evolution of the Web involves the Semantic Web. The semantic web improves web technologies in demand to create, share and connect content through search and analysis based on the capability to comprehend the meaning of words, rather than on keywords or numbers.\r\n3.  **Artificial Intelligence**\\\r\n    Combining this capability with natural language processing, in Web 3.0, computers can distinguish information like humans in order to provide faster and more relevant results. They become more intelligent to fulfil the requirements of users.\r\n4.  **3D Graphics**\\\r\n    The three-dimensional design is being used widely in websites and services in Web 3.0. Museum guides, computer games, ecommerce, geospatial contexts, etc. are all examples that use 3D graphics.\r\n5.  **Connectivity**\\\r\n    With Web 3.0, information is more connected thanks to semantic metadata. As a result, the user experience evolves to another level of connectivity that leverages all the available information.\r\n6.  **Ubiquity**\\\r\n    Content is accessible by multiple applications, every device is connected to the web, the services can be used everywhere.\r\n\r\n**Difference between Web 1.0, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 --**\r\n\r\n| Web 1.0 | Web 2.0 | Web 3.0 |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Mostly Read-Only | Wildly Read-Write | Portable and Personal |\r\n| Company Focus | Community Focus | Individual Focus |\r\n| Home Pages | Blogs / Wikis | Live-streams / Waves |\r\n| Owning Content | Sharing Content | Consolidating Content |\r\n| Web Forms | Web Applications | Smart Applications |\r\n| Directories | Tagging | User Behaviour |\r\n| Page Views | Cost Per Click | User Engagement |\r\n| Banner Advertising | Interactive Advertising | Behavioural Advertising |\r\n| Britannica Online | Wikipedia | The Semantic Web |\r\n| HTML/Portals | XML / RSS | RDF / RDFS / OWL |",/n"The Web Developer bears the responsibility for the coding, design, and layout of the website according to the company's specifications. A website is more important than anything for every business when it comes to reaching clients online. Every business knows today the need to have a website and is trying to design and create the best website to take its products or services online. With incredible progress in launching websites, businesses are searching for people who can build outstanding designs and platforms for their online presence.\r\n\r\n![The-Future-Of-Web-Development](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20200527221351/The-Future-Of-Web-Development.png)\r\n\r\nWeb developers and designers bring their technical skills and experience to the creation and production of exclusive websites capable of attracting the crowd. They are striving to create more reliable sites through all-new frameworks, tools, and advancements.\r\n\r\nWith the technical expertise widespread today, we are on the road to a technologically transforming future. The technology landscape is evolving with artificial intelligence, computer education, the Internet of Things, and quantum computing. And this is even down to their website relationship. Experts from Clever-Solution evaluated the current patterns, listed the most viable ones, and estimated the time expected for their implementation. Let's explore how more space will be created by web weave, with new trends in web development and new trends that will capture or dominate soon.\r\n\r\n### 1\\. [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence-an-introduction/)\r\n\r\nArtificial intelligence does not need to be introduced. Every article on technology, which we read on the web, reflects the need for AI and how it would be the next thing on the web. Several companies and institutions are already implementing AI to meet their needs. Some have reaped the benefits of AI for their businesses.\r\n\r\nAI is the future trend of web space development. It is justified as a lot of progress and advancements have been made in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Leading corporate companies like Google and Microsoft have launched their AI technology for the public, you can build your custom websites with the power of AI. One of the latest AI implementation is the grid, which allows web development a simple process, and initiates content-based development. There are no templates or codes -- all you need to do is provide instructions, and it will lay out what you want.\r\n\r\nADI tools emerge that allow the process of websites to be fairly automated. The important components of a website are Artificial Design Intelligence (ADI) that can build and offer developers options for customized software. In the future, the way websites are created can make a major impact. Going forward in the future can have a major impact on how websites are created. Now is the time for AI web developers who know more about the future, where web development is more likely to give users what they need and not simply to give them what the developer can make. AI should be on your list if you're looking for what capabilities or skills would add to make you a successful web developer.\r\n\r\n### 2\\. [Internet of Things (IoT)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-internet-of-things-iot-set-1/)\r\n\r\nThe Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to the billions of physical devices, objects, animals, or individuals with unique identifiers that are distributed across the network are now connected to the Internet, all of which collect and exchange data, without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.\r\n\r\nIt's a technology that is emerging at a faster rate than imagined. IoT is a future technology that makes our lives in management easy and efficient. Web developers are not directly linked to IoT, but will soon be involved in developing web applications that are needed for analysis and data for their operations. Few companies have started using Application Programming Interfaces, which are used by web developers to communicate with IoT. It would involve a connection between applications and physical devices that would require flexible developers.\r\n\r\nThe IoT developer needs to demonstrate a wide range of skills, including software, hardware programming, networking, systems engineering and user interface, mobile app development, machine learning, and tool knowledge as an individual. If you think that you have all those skills, then you move to achieve a better job as a web developer and with higher pay.\r\n\r\n### 3\\. Virtual Reality\r\n\r\nVirtual reality is the long-awaited dynamic that many thought would take the world by storm, affecting everything in its path. Virtual reality is designed to affect many different elements of web design for a variety of different reasons. VR is sculpting a web path and is set to affect web design in many interesting new ways.\r\n\r\nSome MNCs and giants, such as Google and Microsoft, have already implemented virtual reality or web VRs. Virtual reality can simply be defined as the process of implementing computer technology to create a stimulating environment. VR can put users into an experience that can not be observed in any of the existing traditional interfaces. Instead of accessing a screen placed in front of them, users can engage and interact with the 3D world in real-time.\r\n\r\nVR can help you with virtual tours and other interactive experiences that allow users to experience something before buying a product or service. Industries are looking for developers who can create web apps for businesses that allow potential customers to have virtual experience with a business product or service. This would include taking on responsibility for research, evaluation, implementation, and testing of new and innovative VR methodologies in the context of the web experience they are developing.\r\n\r\n### 4\\. 360-Degree Video\r\n\r\nThe 360-degree video offers a significantly enhanced user interface that leads to the creation and growth of websites. The 360 degrees are guaranteed to draw more attention, thus enhancing interaction for more views. It enriches the user's experience as if he or she is genuinely present. The video clips cover a view of the spherical scenario in 360 degrees, while the camera captures a view of all possible angles to a seamless future experience. The ultimate objective is to provide end-users with high-tech features.\r\n\r\nIt becomes easier to create a 360-degree video experience if you have sufficient and enough experience in VR technology. If you have experience and expertise as a web developer with the new and best modern technologies, it helps to increase the visibility of a company's brand.\r\n\r\n### 5\\. Voice Command\r\n\r\nAn example of artificial intelligence implementation. This wasn't so amazing before, because this technology just worked poorly. High-quality voice input items were extremely expensive. But it's one of the trends now. In several smartphone and web applications voice commands are actively implemented. You can call Uber, too, by voice. You don't have to spend time using your application, so life is much easier.\r\n\r\nVoice input is another technique to enhance user experience. Voice search must be taken seriously in the development of the website. Web designers are now trying to figure out ways to incorporate this successfully into their websites. They must even be able to record user activity from voice searches for people involved in digital marketing. A third of internet users already think that voice searches are relevant and this trend will expand further. That is why web development shapes the future.\r\n\r\n### 6\\. Motion User Interface\r\n\r\nMotion design helps to make user interfaces attractive and intuitive. When correctly used, motion can guide your digital product user experience by conveying a message about your brand. To add value and enhance many aspects of their interaction, you can align animation to the preferences of your users.\r\n\r\nAs you might know, the Motion UI is a SaaS library used in custom CSS, Web developers also can create attractive designs that enable unique transitions and animations that contribute to boosting website appearance and generate user interest. One of the interesting features of a motion user interface is that it provides a lot of simplicity which users love. It's easy to understand and comprehend. Take the skills needed for the motion interface and you are on demand.\r\n\r\nWeb development is a field that is constantly evolving. If you choose a career in web development, you would need to keep up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. Always remember that a website is the face of a business, and if you're part of a project, make sure you give it the best. Also, the future of web development depends entirely on the desires of users. There is enough technology today to satisfy these desires. Because the \"future\" is already here today. We're just going to see his improvement.",/n"The term Machine Learning was coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence and stated that \"it gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\".\\\r\nAnd in 1997, Tom Mitchell gave a \"well-posed\" mathematical and relational definition that \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\r\n\r\nMachine Learning is a latest buzzword floating around. It deserves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science. So what does Machine Learning really mean?\r\n\r\nLet's try to understand Machine Learning in layman terms. Consider you are trying to toss a paper to a dustbin.\r\n\r\nAfter first attempt, you realize that you have put too much force in it. After second attempt, you realize you are closer to target but you need to increase your throw angle. What is happening here is basically after every throw we are learning something and improving the end result. We are programmed to learn from our experience.\r\n\r\nThis implies that the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\"\\\r\nWithin the field of data analytics, machine learning is used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics. These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to \"produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results\" and uncover \"hidden insights\" through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data set(input).\r\n\r\nSuppose that you decide to check out that offer for a vacation . You browse through the travel agency website and search for a hotel. When you look at a specific hotel, just below the hotel description there is a section titled \"You might also like these hotels\". This is a common use case of Machine Learning called \"Recommendation Engine\". Again, many data points were used to train a model in order to predict what will be the best hotels to show you under that section, based on a lot of information they already know about you.\r\n\r\nSo if you want your program to predict, for example, traffic patterns at a busy intersection (task T), you can run it through a machine learning algorithm with data about past traffic patterns (experience E) and, if it has successfully \"learned\", it will then do better at predicting future traffic patterns (performance measure P).\\\r\nThe highly complex nature of many real-world problems, though, often means that inventing specialized algorithms that will solve them perfectly every time is impractical, if not impossible. Examples of machine learning problems include, \"Is this cancer?\", \"Which of these people are good friends with each other?\", \"Will this person like this movie?\" such problems are excellent targets for Machine Learning, and in fact machine learning has been applied such problems with great success.\r\n\r\n**Classification of Machine Learning**\r\n\r\nMachine learning implementations are classified into three major categories, depending on the nature of the learning \"signal\" or \"response\" available to a learning system which are as follows:-\r\n\r\n1.  **Supervised learning : **When an algorithm learns from example data and associated target responses that can consist of numeric values or string labels, such as classes or tags, in order to later predict the correct response when posed with new examples comes under the category of Supervised learning. This approach is indeed similar to human learning under the supervision of a teacher. The teacher provides good examples for the student to memorize, and the student then derives general rules from these specific examples.\r\n2.  **Unsupervised learning :**Whereas when an algorithm learns from plain examples without any associated response, leaving to the algorithm to determine the data patterns on its own. This type of algorithm tends to restructure the data into something else, such as new features that may represent a class or a new series of un-correlated values. They are quite useful in providing humans with insights into the meaning of data and new useful inputs to supervised machine learning algorithms.\\\r\n    As a kind of learning, it resembles the methods humans use to figure out that certain objects or events are from the same class, such as by observing the degree of similarity between objects. Some recommendation systems that you find on the web in the form of marketing automation are based on this type of learning.\r\n3.  **Reinforcement learning : **When you present the algorithm with examples that lack labels, as in unsupervised learning. However, you can accompany an example with positive or negative feedback according to the solution the algorithm proposes comes under the category of Reinforcement learning, which is connected to applications for which the algorithm must make decisions (so the product is prescriptive, not just descriptive, as in unsupervised learning), and the decisions bear consequences. In the human world, it is just like learning by trial and error.\\\r\n    Errors help you learn because they have a penalty added (cost, loss of time, regret, pain, and so on), teaching you that a certain course of action is less likely to succeed than others. An interesting example of reinforcement learning occurs when computers learn to play video games by themselves.\\\r\n    In this case, an application presents the algorithm with examples of specific situations, such as having the gamer stuck in a maze while avoiding an enemy. The application lets the algorithm know the outcome of actions it takes, and learning occurs while trying to avoid what it discovers to be dangerous and to pursue survival. You can have a look at how the company Google DeepMind has created a reinforcement learning program that plays old Atari's video games. When watching the video, notice how the program is initially clumsy and unskilled but steadily improves with training until it becomes a champion.\r\n4.  **Semi-supervised learning :** where an incomplete training signal is given: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing. There is a special case of this principle known as Transduction where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time, except that part of the targets are missing.\r\n\r\n**Categorizing**** on the basis of required Output**\r\n\r\nAnother categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machine-learned system:\r\n\r\n1.  **Classification :** When inputs are divided into two or more classes, and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes. This is typically tackled in a supervised way. Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes are \"spam\" and \"not spam\".\r\n2.  **Regression :** Which is also a supervised problem, A case when the outputs are continuous rather than discrete.\r\n3.  **Clustering :** When a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task.\r\n\r\nMachine Learning comes into the picture when problems cannot be solved by means of typical approaches.",/n"**Introduction**\r\n\r\nMachine learning is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that which makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect. We probably use a learning algorithm dozens of time without even knowing it. Applications of Machine Learning include:\r\n\r\n-   **Web Search Engine:** One of the reasons why search engines like google, bing etc work so well is because the system has learnt how to rank pages through a complex learning algorithm.\r\n\r\n-   **Photo tagging Applications:** Be it facebook or any other photo tagging application, the ability to tag friends makes it even more happening. It is all possible because of a face recognition algorithm that runs behind the application.\r\n\r\n-   **Spam Detector:** Our mail agent like Gmail or Hotmail does a lot of hard work for us in classifying the mails and moving the spam mails to spam folder. This is again achieved by a spam classifier running in the back end of mail application.\r\n\r\nToday, companies are using Machine Learning to improve business decisions,increase productivity, detect disease, forecast weather, and do many more things. With the exponential growth of technology, we not only need better tools to understand the data we currently have, but we also need to prepare ourselves for the data we will have. To achieve this goal we need to build intelligent machines. We can write a program to do simple things. But for most of times Hardwiring Intelligence in it is difficult. Best way to do it is to have some way for machines to learn things themselves. A mechanism for learning -- if a machine can learn from input then it does the hard work for us. This is where Machine Learning comes in action. Some examples of machine learning are:\r\n\r\n-   **Database Mining for growth of automation:** Typical applications include Web-click data for better UX( User eXperience), Medical records for better automation in healthcare, biological data and many more.\r\n\r\n-   **Applications that cannot be programmed:** There are some tasks that cannot be programmed as the computers we use are not modelled that way. Examples include Autonomous Driving, Recognition tasks from unordered data (Face Recognition/ Handwriting Recognition), Natural language Processing, computer Vision etc.\r\n-   **Understanding Human Learning:** This is the closest we have understood and mimicked the human brain. It is the start of a new revolution, The real AI. Now, After a brief insight lets come to a more formal definition of Machine Learning\r\n-   **Arthur Samuel(1959):** \"Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers, the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.\"Samuel wrote a Checker playing program which could learn over time. At first it could be easily won. But over time, it learnt all the board position that would eventually lead him to victory or loss and thus became a better chess player than Samuel itself. This was one of the most early attempts of defining Machine Learning and is somewhat less formal.\r\n-   **Tom Michel(1999):** \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\" This is a more formal and mathematical definition. For the previous Chess program\r\n    -   E is number of games.\r\n    -   T is playing chess against computer.\r\n    -   P is win/loss by computer.",/n"Machine Learning, as the name suggests, is the science of programming a computer by which they are able to learn from different kinds of data. A more general definition given by Arthur Samuel is -- \"Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\" They are typically used to solve various types of life problems.\\\r\nIn the older days, people used to perform Machine Learning tasks by manually coding all the algorithms and mathematical and statistical formula. This made the process time consuming, tedious and inefficient. But in the modern days, it is become very much easy and efficient compared to the olden days by various python libraries, frameworks, and modules. Today, Python is one of the most popular programming languages for this task and it has replaced many languages in the industry, one of the reason is its vast collection of libraries. Python libraries that used in Machine Learning are:\r\n\r\n-   Numpy\r\n-   Scipy\r\n-   Scikit-learn\r\n-   Theano\r\n-   TensorFlow\r\n-   Keras\r\n-   PyTorch\r\n-   Pandas\r\n-   Matplotlib\r\n\r\n#### Numpy\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/image5-1.jpeg)\\\r\nNumPy is a very popular python library for large multi-dimensional array and matrix processing, with the help of a large collection of high-level mathematical functions. It is very useful for fundamental scientific computations in Machine Learning. It is particularly useful for linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. High-end libraries like TensorFlow uses NumPy internally for manipulation of Tensors.\r\n\r\n|\r\n\r\n`# Python program using NumPy `\r\n\r\n`# for some basic mathematical `\r\n\r\n`# operations`\r\n\r\n`import` `numpy as np`\r\n\r\n`# Creating two arrays of rank 2`\r\n\r\n`x` `=` `np.array([[``1``,` `2``], [``3``,` `4``]])`\r\n\r\n`y` `=` `np.array([[``5``,` `6``], [``7``,` `8``]])`\r\n\r\n`# Creating two arrays of rank 1`\r\n\r\n`v` `=` `np.array([``9``,` `10``])`\r\n\r\n`w` `=` `np.array([``11``,` `12``])`\r\n\r\n`# Inner product of vectors`\r\n\r\n`print``(np.dot(v, w),` `\"\\n\"``)`\r\n\r\n`# Matrix and Vector product`\r\n\r\n`print``(np.dot(x, v),` `\"\\n\"``)`\r\n\r\n`# Matrix and matrix product`\r\n\r\n`print``(np.dot(x, y))`\r\n\r\n |\r\n\r\n**Output:**\r\n\r\n219\r\n\r\n[29 67]\r\n\r\n[[19 22]\r\n [43 50]]\r\n\r\nFor more details refer to [Numpy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-numpy/).\r\n\r\n#### SciPy\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/image6.png)\\\r\nSciPy is a very popular library among Machine Learning enthusiasts as it contains different modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration and statistics.

It is not directly related to Machine Learning. As we know that the dataset must be prepared before training. In this case, Pandas comes handy as it was developed specifically for data extraction and preparation. It provides high-level data structures and wide variety tools for data analysis. It provides many inbuilt methods for groping, combining and filtering data.\r\n\r\n|\r\n\r\n`# Python program using Pandas for `\r\n\r\n`# arranging a given set of data `\r\n\r\n`# into a  table`\r\n\r\n`# importing pandas as pd`\r\n\r\n`import` `pandas as pd`\r\n\r\n`data` `=` `{``\"country\"``: [``\"Brazil\"``,` `\"Russia\"``,` `\"India\"``,` `\"China\"``,` `\"South Africa\"``],`\r\n\r\n`\"capital\"``: [``\"Brasilia\"``,` `\"Moscow\"``,` `\"New Dehli\"``,` `\"Beijing\"``,` `\"Pretoria\"``],`\r\n\r\n`\"area\"``: [``8.516``,` `17.10``,` `3.286``,` `9.597``,` `1.221``],`\r\n\r\n`\"population\"``: [``200.4``,` `143.5``,` `1252``,` `1357``,` `52.98``] }`\r\n\r\n`data_table` `=` `pd.DataFrame(data)`\r\n\r\n`print``(data_table)`\r\n\r\n |\r\n\r\n**Output:**\\\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/image17.jpg)\\\r\nFor more details refer to [Pandas](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-dataframe/).\r\n\r\n#### Matplotlib\r\n\r\n![matplotlibLogo](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/matplotlib_logo.png)\\\r\nMatpoltlib is a very popular Python library for data visualization. Like Pandas, it is not directly related to Machine Learning. It particularly comes in handy when a programmer wants to visualize the patterns in the data. It is a 2D plotting library used for creating 2D graphs and plots. A module named pyplot makes it easy for programmers for plotting as it provides features to control line styles, font properties, formatting axes, etc. It provides various kinds of graphs and plots for data visualization, viz., histogram, error charts, bar chats, etc,\r\n\r\n`#  Python program using Matplotib `\r\n\r\n`# for forming a linear plot`\r\n\r\n`# importing the necessary packages and modules`\r\n\r\n`import` `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`\r\n\r\n`import` `numpy as np`\r\n\r\n`# Prepare the data`\r\n\r\n`x` `=` `np.linspace(``0``,` `10``,` `100``)`\r\n\r\n`# Plot the data`\r\n\r\n`plt.plot(x, x, label` `=``'linear'``)`\r\n\r\n`# Add a legend`\r\n\r\n`plt.legend()`\r\n\r\n`# Show the plot`\r\n\r\n`plt.show()`",/n"**Types of machine learning problems**\r\n\r\nThere are various ways to classify machine learning problems. Here, we discuss the most obvious ones.\\\r\n**1\\. On basis of the nature of the learning \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to a learning system**\r\n\r\n-   **Supervised learning**: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves the desired level of accuracy on the training data. Some real-life examples are:\r\n    -   **Image Classification:** You train with images/labels. Then in the future you give a new image expecting that the computer will recognize the new object.\r\n    -   **Market Prediction/Regression:** You train the computer with historical market data and ask the computer to predict the new price in the future.\r\n\r\n-   **Unsupervised learning**: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. It is used for clustering population in different groups. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data).\r\n    -   **Clustering:** You ask the computer to separate similar data into clusters, this is essential in research and science.\r\n    -   **High Dimension Visualization:** Use the computer to help us visualize high dimension data.\r\n    -   **Generative Models:** After a model captures the probability distribution of your input data, it will be able to generate more data. This can be very useful to make your classifier more robust.\r\n\r\nA simple diagram which clears the concept of supervised and unsupervised learning is shown below:\\\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/supervised_learning-.png)![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/unsupervised_learning-.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see clearly, the data in supervised learning is labelled, where as data in unsupervised learning is unlabelled.\r\n\r\n-   **Semi-supervised learning**: Problems where you have a large amount of input data and only some of the data is labeled, are called semi-supervised learning problems. These problems sit in between both supervised and unsupervised learning. For example, a photo archive where only some of the images are labeled, (e.g. dog, cat, person) and the majority are unlabeled.\r\n\r\n-   **Reinforcement learning**: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). The program is provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space.\r\n\r\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200212121948/reinforcement_learning-11.png)\\\r\n**2\\. On the basis of \"output\" desired from a machine learned system**\r\n\r\n-   **Classification**: Inputs are divided into two or more classes, and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes. This is typically tackled in a supervised way. Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes are \"spam\" and \"not spam\".\r\n-   **Regression**: It is also a supervised learning problem, but the outputs are continuous rather than discrete. For example, predicting the stock prices using historical data.\r\n\r\nAn example of classification and regression on two different datasets is shown below: ![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/classification_regression.png)\r\n\r\n-   **Clustering**: Here, a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task.\\\r\n    As you can see in the example below, the given dataset points have been divided into groups identifiable by the colors red, green and blue.\r\n\r\n    ![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/clustering-1.png)\r\n\r\n-   **Density estimation**: The task is to find the distribution of inputs in some space.\r\n-   **Dimensionality reduction**: It simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lower-dimensional space. Topic modeling is a related problem, where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these machine learning tasks/problems, we have a number of algorithms which are used to accomplish these tasks. Some commonly used machine learning algorithms are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM(Support vector machines), Naive Bayes, KNN(K nearest neighbors), K-Means, Random Forest, etc.\r\n\r\n**Note:** All these algorithms will be covered in upcoming articles.\r\n\r\n**Terminologies of Machine Learning**\r\n\r\n-   **Model**\\\r\n    A model is a **specific representation** learned from data by applying some machine learning algorithm. A model is also called **hypothesis**.\r\n-   **Feature**\\\r\n    A feature is an individual measurable property of our data. A set of numeric features can be conveniently described by a **feature vector**. Feature vectors are fed as input to the model. For example, in order to predict a fruit, there may be features like color, smell, taste, **etc.**\\\r\n    **Note:** Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms. We generally employ a **feature extractor** to extract the relevant features from the raw data.\r\n-   **Target (Label)**\\\r\n    A target variable or label is the value to be predicted by our model. For the fruit example discussed in the features section, the label with each set of input would be the name of the fruit like apple, orange, banana, etc.\r\n-   **Training**\\\r\n    The idea is to give a set of inputs(features) and it's expected outputs(labels), so after training, we will have a model (hypothesis) that will then map new data to one of the categories trained on.\r\n-   **Prediction**\\\r\n    Once our model is ready, it can be fed a set of inputs to which it will provide a predicted output(label).",/n"The race to fill retiring Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman's Senate seat currently features one unofficial candidate and two official ones: a person flirting with QAnon-style conspiracy theories, someone whose Twitter account was recently suspended because of bigoted tweets, and a third person who's calling for Rep. Anthony Gonzalez's (R-OH) resignation simply because he voted to impeach then-President Trump.\r\n![Jane Timken speaks into a microphone.](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JKvHNcfpKEUurfs9GxGhc-hxCYI=/0x0:2048x1536/1200x800/filters:focal(835x612:1161x938)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029684/822876478.0.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf this primary serves as a window into what the Republican Party will look like heading into the 2022 midterms, it's not a pretty picture --- and one dominated by the divisive, conspiratorial politics favored by Trump.

[Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday](http://vox.com/weeds-newsletter).\r\n\r\n### J.D. Vance has gone full Tucker Carlson\r\n\r\nThe QAnon-curious figure in the race is J.D. Vance, author of the bestselling memoir *Hillbilly Elegy*, which was released in June 2016 and was \"praised [by some publications](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2016/08/17/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-donald-trump-usa-today-best-selling-books-book-buzz/88862854/) as a skeleton key to Trumpism,\" as my colleague Alissa Wilkinson recently [put it](https://www.vox.com/culture/21547861/hillbilly-elegy-review-netflix) in her review of the film adaptation of the book.\r\n\r\n*Hillbilly Elegy* detailed the cultural milieu in which support for a populist demagogue like Trump could thrive. But Vance didn't try to hide the fact that he wasn't a Trump fan during the 2016 campaign, [saying](https://thebulwark.com/j-d-vance-joins-the-jackals/), \"I can't stomach Trump. I think that he's noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place.\"\r\n\r\nBut now that Trump has made it nearly impossible to function in Republican politics without unyielding support for him --- recent [polling](https://morningconsult.com/2021/02/16/trump-gop-support-impeachment-poll/) indicates a majority of Republicans would support him in a hypothetical 2024 Republican primary --- the 36-year-old Vance is singing a different tune.\r\n\r\nIn recent months, Vance has approvingly retweeted the likes of Donald Trump Jr. and Dinesh D'Souza; done softball interviews with Tucker Carlson and far-right former Trump administration official [Seb Gorka](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/8/25/15505180/sebastian-gorka-out-resign); tweeted Trump-style attacks on the media (for instance [asking](https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1361525600888963072), \"Why are so many members of the press such incredible babies?\"); and promoted a [QAnon](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/1/17253444/qanon-trump-conspiracy-theory-4chan-explainer)-inspired conspiracy theory by suggesting a group of unrelated sexual misconduct cases is evidence of a cabal.\r\n\r\n\"Someone should have asked Jeffrey Epstein, John Weaver, or Leon Black about the CRAZY CONSPIRACY that many powerful people were predators targeting children,\" Vance tweeted on February 11.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that Vance has expressed interest in policy, his platform has largely centered on immigration restrictionism, complaining about Trump being banished from Facebook and Twitter, calling out alleged liberal hypocrisy, and trying to make hay out of Trumpist culture war wedge issues like the supposed cancelation of Dr. Seuss.\r\n\r\nIn short, Vance has gone full Tucker Carlson.\r\n\r\nVance hasn't officially entered the Ohio Senate race yet, but he already has a super PAC supporting him called Protect Ohio Values that recently [received $10 million](https://www.vox.com/recode/22332045/peter-thiel-jd-vance-ohio-senate-donation) from tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel.\r\n\r\nVance's brand of Trumpism isn't necessarily as stark as that of the other two candidates in the race --- though he's only posted 98 tweets, just one of them mentions Trump by name. But his soft-pedaling of conspiracy theories, embrace of conspiracy theorists, focus on stoking division with culture war grievances, and attacks on the \"[elites](https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1373662583975215106)\" (despite his Yale Law School background) indicates whatever reservations he once had about Trumpism have fallen by the wayside.\r\n\r\n### The other two candidates are working even harder for Trump's endorsement\r\n\r\nThe two candidates who have officially launched campaigns to replace Portman are former Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel and former Ohio GOP chair Jane Timken. And, like Vance, neither of them has exactly bathed themselves in glory so far.\r\n\r\nMandel's Twitter account was recently restricted for \"hateful conduct,\" as the Cincinnati Enquirer [explains](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/18/twitter-temporarily-blocks-ohio-senate-candidate-josh-mandel-over-hateful-conduct/4755165001/):\r\n\r\n> Mandel's account created a poll [on March 18] about which type of \"illegals\" would commit more crimes, \"Muslim Terrorists\" or \"Mexican Gangbangers.\" His campaign later shared that the account was temporarily suspended for 12 hours for violating Twitter's policies on \"hateful conduct.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Mandel's tweet was racist in multiple respects, he's unrepentant. After his account was unrestricted, he posted a tweet claiming, \"Just like President Trump, I was canceled by @twitter @jack yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wear this as a badge of honor as Big Tech thugs & elites target those who they are most afraid of,\" he added. \"Our movement of steel-spined Constitutional Conservatives & Trump Warriors will not be silenced.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond Trump-style bigotry, Mandel's platform largely seems to be that he loves Trump more than anyone else. His Twitter bio boasts that he was the \"1st Statewide Official in Ohio to support President Trump.\" When he officially launched his campaign on February 10, he said he's \"going to Washington to fight for President Trump's America First Agenda.\"\r\n\r\nBut all this fawning over Trump apparently hasn't been enough to give Mandel pole position for Trump's endorsement. That distinction reportedly belongs to Timken, whom Trump wanted to endorse before being talked out of it late last month on the grounds that doing so would be premature, according to [Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-endorsement-ohio-senate-2022-d7ef0b0d-c993-485f-af08-1990ed6fdd11.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_content=politics-trumpmidterms).\r\n\r\nTimken made headlines a few weeks ago for calling on her Congress member, Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, to resign. Gonzalez was one of 10 House Republicans to vote for Trump's impeachment.\r\n\r\n\"President Trump is the leader of our Party and we must have conservative leaders committed to the team if we are going to keep Ohio red and win back majorities in the U.S. House and Senate in 2022,\" Timken said in a statement. \"Gonzalez should put his constituents and the Republican Party first by resigning from Congress.\"\r\n\r\nBut Timken gave very different comments about Gonzalez before she announced her campaign in February, with her later remarks apparently an indication of what she thinks it'll take to win the race.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to Cleveland.com, Timken [praised](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/02/will-the-ohio-gop-move-on-from-trump-a-qa-with-chairman-jane-timken.html) Gonzalez, describing him as \"a very effective legislator\" and \"a very good person.\" That interview was conducted after the impeachment vote, so the only thing that changed between then and the statement Timken released calling for Gonzalez's resignation is that she announced she's running for office.\r\n\r\n### The Ohio race is playing out just the way Trump wants it to\r\n\r\nTrump's decisive loss in November to Biden and subsequent campaign to overturn the result --- an effort lowlighted by the [January 6 insurrection](https://www.vox.com/22220746/trump-speech-incite-capitol-riot) at the US Capitol --- provided the Republican Party with its latest opportunity to turn the page from Trumpism. But, as has repeatedly been the case since Trump won the Republican primary in 2016, the party refused to take it.\r\n\r\nA total of 17 Republicans in the House and Senate voted for Trump's impeachment or removal in connection with the insurrection. But those Republicans were quickly ostracized from the more powerful MAGA faction of the party. For instance, Trump loyalist Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) traveled to Wyoming to give a speech denouncing House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney (WY) for her yes vote for impeachment, and Trump denounced Republicans who voted against him by name to applause during his February speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, which doubled as [a weekend-long celebration of all things Trump](https://www.vox.com/2021/2/28/22306318/trump-cpac-2021-speech-election-lies).\r\n\r\nIt's more than just rhetoric. Trump is [attempting a hostile takeover](https://www.vox.com/22321215/trump-rnc-cease-and-desist-fundraising-feud-purge) of the GOP by asking his supporters to donate to him instead of the Republican National Committee (RNC) and other prominent Republican groups. He's also made clear that he thinks \"RINOS\" (Republicans in name only) like Gonzalez who supported his impeachment should be purged from the party.\r\n\r\nAnd Trump has already [endorsed](https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/politics/elections/candidates/former-president-trump-max-miller-gop-primary-northeast-ohio-rep-anthony-gonzalez/95-f3423394-209b-4726-91e4-f37b8e6afa62) the candidacy of Max Miller, a former White House aide of his who is primarying Gonzalez.\r\n\r\n### This is partly a story about Ohio, but mostly one about the Republican Party\r\n\r\nOhio is traditionally thought of as a purple, bellwether state, but it has been trending redder since 2012, when then-President Barack Obama carried the state with a slim majority.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Trump easily won there, besting Hillary Clinton by more than 8 percentage points. But Trump's margin looked downright slim compared to Portman's, who won reelection by more than 20 percentage points over Democratic ex-Gov. Ted Strickland. Trump again carried Ohio easily last November, beating Biden by about the same margin as he beat Clinton four years earlier.\r\n\r\nThis isn't to say that Democrats can no longer win in Ohio. The other US senator from the state, Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown, won reelection for his third term in 2018 over ex-Rep. Jim Renacci by a comfortable margin of about 7 percentage points. But all else being equal, whoever prevails in the Republican primary --- particularly if they have Trump's blessing --- will likely be the favorite to fill Portman's seat.\r\n\r\nUltimately, however, the story of the primary to replace Portman is more about the direction of the Republican Party than it is about Ohio. The defining issue of the race is Trump --- how much a candidate supports him, whether he has endorsed them, and how like him they are. Losing reelection and presiding over the GOP's loss of both chambers of Congress wasn't enough to shake his hold on the party.",/n"<iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K3odScka55A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nThree different Covid-19 vaccines are now being distributed across the United States, and all three are highly effective at the most important thing: preventing hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19. But some people remain worried that Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is less effective at preventing disease to begin with.\r\n\r\nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan this week turned down 6,200 Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses for his city. “Johnson & Johnson is a very good vaccine. Moderna and Pfizer are the best,” Duggan said in a news conference. “And I am going to do everything I can to make sure that residents of the city of Detroit get the best.”\r\n\r\nScientists say that this is the wrong way to think about Covid-19 vaccines, and that judging the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as inferior based on its lower reported efficacy is misleading.\r\n\r\nSuch actions are especially worrying at the current stage of the pandemic. Covid-19 has killed more than 500,000 Americans, and while cases seem to be declining, the virus is still spreading, new variants are gaining ground, and some parts of the country are already relaxing precautions (which health officials warn could end up prolonging the pandemic).\r\n\r\nTurning down vaccine doses while supplies of all Covid-19 vaccines are still stretched thin undermines the campaign to curb the pandemic.\r\n\r\nIn clinical trials, the vaccines produced by Pfizer/BioNTech, by Moderna, and by Johnson & Johnson reduced the fatality rate of Covid-19 by 100 percent compared to their placebo groups. They also kept all recipients out of the hospital. That means they can potentially downgrade Covid-19 from a public health crisis to a manageable problem.\r\n\r\n“The goal of a vaccine was really to defang or tame this virus, to make it more like other respiratory viruses that we deal with, so when you look at the three approved vaccines in the US, all of them are extremely good at that metric,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\r\n\r\nThe vaccines do have some important differences. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is one dose, while the others require two. It also can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, while the others require freezer temperatures. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is also less expensive, about $10 per dose, roughly half as much as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The Moderna vaccine costs between $25 and $37 per dose.\r\n\r\nThese factors give Johnson & Johnson an edge in logistics and could help the shots get to people in harder-to-reach places. Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told Vox last month that it’s a vaccine that “can increase equity.”\r\n\r\nBut when Johnson & Johnson filed for an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for its Covid-19 vaccine in early February, it reported that its overall efficacy in preventing Covid-19 cases that produced symptoms was 66.1 percent. The Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines reported efficacy levels around 95 percent.\r\n\r\nThat gap in efficacy numbers is fueling some people’s perception that the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine isn’t as good. However, scientists say that these numbers can’t be fairly compared to one another. The efficacy levels of the Covid-19 vaccines are specific to the clinical trials that produced them, and those trials were not conducted in the same ways.\r\n\r\nIn addition, health officials have been emphasizing that the most important numbers — how well the vaccines prevent hospitalizations and deaths — are consistent across the board and are arguably more comparable. Even after these vaccines have begun distribution, researchers are finding that Covid-19 vaccines are doing a remarkable job of keeping people alive.\r\n\r\nThat’s why the recommendation remains that the best Covid-19 vaccine for the vast majority of people is the first one they can get. “That’s how I think of these vaccines, as basically interchangeable,” said Adalja.\r\n\r\n### Why it’s hard to make direct comparisons between the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine and the ones from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech\r\n\r\nTo gauge how well vaccines work, companies test them in several stages, looking to ensure they are safe, to find the correct dose, and to figure out how much protection they provide. These trials are designed to test vaccines individually, not to pit them against each other. So direct comparisons don’t always make sense, and one has to be careful to understand the nuances of how each result was obtained.\r\n\r\nBut health officials have acknowledged that the earlier results of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines shifted expectations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\r\n\r\n“If this had occurred in the absence of a prior announcement and implementation of a 94, 95 percent efficacy [vaccine], one would have said this is an absolutely spectacular result,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine during the press conference in January.\r\n\r\nIn phase 3 clinical trials, Covid-19 vaccines were tested against the virus in the real world, in actual people against the actual virus. This involves testing tens of thousands of participants to see who ends up showing symptoms, randomly dividing them into groups that receive the actual vaccine and groups that receive a placebo (without revealing who got what).\r\n\r\nTesting in the real world means dealing with all the confounding factors of the real world. Depending on which volunteers are selected and where they are, they face different infection rates of the virus. They have varying access to health care. Some places had stricter lockdowns than others, or started them at varying times, so participants experienced different public health measures. Michigan issued a mask mandate in March 2020 while California issued one in June 2020, for example.\r\n\r\nTiming is critical too. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech studies finished enrolling participants in their phase 3 trials in October and reported their results in late November. The Johnson & Johnson phase 3 trial only finished enrolling participants in December 2020 and reported their results in January.\r\n\r\nThat means the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was tested during one of the most severe stages of the pandemic, when transmission, cases, and hospitalizations were at their worst in many places around the world, including the US. The trial also captured efficacy against the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) which began circulating at this point in some parts of the world. Several of these variants have shown themselves to be more contagious, deadlier, and more likely to evade protection from vaccines and prior immunity.\r\n\r\nAnd Johnson & Johnson’s efficacy results included trials in other countries, whereas the results from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech were mainly from US-based participants.\r\n\r\nJohnson & Johnson found that vaccine efficacy shifted depending on the country in which it was studied. The vaccine was found to have a 72 percent overall efficacy after four weeks in preventing Covid-19 symptoms in the US. Under the same benchmarks in South Africa, where a coronavirus variant with worrisome mutations that help it escape vaccines has been spreading widely, the company found a 64 percent efficacy.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to preventing severe and critical cases of Covid-19, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85.9 percent efficacious in the US, while in South Africa, efficacy against severe and critical disease was reduced to 81.7 percent.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these vaccines were tested in different ways at different times is why it’s so hard to make apples-to-apples comparisons. “I don’t even look at those efficacy numbers and compare them head-to-head like that,” Adalja said. “Biostats 101: You cannot compare trial results like that unless they were done in a head-to-head fashion.”\r\n\r\n### Researchers still need more information about Covid-19 vaccines, especially as new variants spread\r\n\r\nThe huge emphasis on the fact that vaccines prevent hospitalizations and death doesn’t mean that preventing the symptoms of Covid-19 is not important. Millions of people in the US have preexisting health conditions and could suffer from the disease even if they don’t end up in the hospital. About 10 percent of Covid-19 survivors have reported persistent symptoms even after the virus has faded away, the so-called long haulers. It hints that the disease can cause long-term damage.\r\n\r\nAnd while vaccines can protect an individual, it’s less clear how well they prevent transmission from person to person (although evidence is mounting that the available Covid-19 vaccines reduce the virus’ spread). That’s why vaccinated people are encouraged to continue wearing masks until vaccinations are widespread.\r\n\r\nAn ideal Covid-19 vaccine would reduce deaths, hospitalizations, symptoms, and transmission, and right now, all of the three Covid-19 vaccines available in the US check these boxes, even for people with risk factors for severe disease or long-term illness.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t be picky if I’m a high-risk person, because being picky may leave you out in the cold of not being vaccinated,” said Lawrence Corey, a professor studying virology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. “We have still an incredible epidemic going on here.”\r\n\r\nThere are some people with a history of severe allergic reactions or certain immunological conditions who will have to be careful about selecting a vaccine, and some may not be able to receive one at all. But that makes it all the more important to vaccinate everyone around a vulnerable person, which helps build herd immunity.\r\n\r\nThe looming concern, though, is how well Covid-19 vaccines will hold up as the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to mutate and new variants arise. Already, vaccine manufacturers are investigating booster doses and modifications of their shots to better counter the newer versions of the virus.\r\n\r\nResearchers will also have to figure out how well existing vaccines are holding up against the variants in the real world. While vaccine clinical trials were conducted independently of each other, it would behoove scientists to coordinate from here on out, sharing protocols and pooling data to draw more useful conclusions.\r\n\r\n“Imagine what will happen when these studies generate results, each with their own populations, eligibility criteria, validation procedures and clinical endpoints,” wrote Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, in Nature. “If we don’t want our final answers to be a jumble, we must act now to consider how data can be compared and combined.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it’s important to keep in mind that vaccines are one part of a comprehensive public health response to Covid-19. Social distancing, hand-washing, mask-wearing, testing, tracing, and isolation remain critical to speeding up progress toward the end of the pandemic.

Foreigners transferring to the US offices of their multinational companies through L visas, including business executives, and some scholars and people participating in cultural and work exchanges on J-1 visas, were also banned.\r\n\r\nAlthough Trump administration officials argued, at the time the ban was instituted, that it would save 525,000 American jobs, most of the layoffs ultimately occurred in industries that do not employ a significant number of foreign workers coming on visas. This suggests that the ban did little to lower unemployment and could have harmed companies that employ both Americans and noncitizens.\r\n\r\nThe ban always excluded immigrants who are already in the US, existing visa holders, temporary workers in food production industries, and health care workers and researchers fighting Covid-19.\r\n\r\n### It might be a while longer before visa processing returns to normal\r\n\r\nAlthough Biden is allowing the ban to sunset, many foreign workers are still facing pandemic-related travel bans for most of Europe, Brazil, China, Iran, and South Africa and are still barred from entering the US.\r\n\r\nEven those who are now eligible to enter the US could face additional months of waiting before their visa applications are processed. Consulates abroad where visa interviews are conducted still aren’t fully operational due to the pandemic. They also haven’t been bringing in enough revenue, since their budgets rely in part on fees from visa applicants.\r\n\r\nWith limited resources, consulates are prioritizing applications for people seeking to immigrate to the US permanently, as opposed to those on temporary worker visas. The State Department said that, as of February, there was an extensive backlog of 473,000 such applicants — and that number even excludes cases where applicants haven’t had an interview or are still pulling together the required documents.\r\n\r\nThe State Department has taken steps to speed up processing, including announcing that it will waive interviews for people who were previously issued a visa in the same category in the recent past. But Dalal-Dheini said that officials should also consider additional interview waivers, automatic extensions of visas that may have expired while immigrants couldn’t enter the US, and revalidating visas for people already in the US without them having to leave the country.\r\n\r\nFor some foreign workers, however, the waiting game might be too long.\r\n\r\n“People aren’t going to be able to sit around and wait for the policies to be overturned and the processes to catch up when there’s opportunity to go elsewhere,” Dalal-Dheini said. “They’ll go elsewhere. Or, as the pandemic has proven, people can work from wherever, so don’t have to come to the US.” \r\nTrump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump",/n"UI design and especially its more artistic, visual side is constantly evolving. While most current products repeat the same, trusted and well-known IA patterns, UI and the Value Proposition are the biggest differentiators the product can have.\r\n\r\nNobody is going to try and redesign a registration process that works well in thousands of other apps — we’ll tweak it, for sure, and hopefully with some research, but in the end, it will just be a copy of what the users already know.\r\n### All the morphisms\r\n\r\nBoth Neumorphism and Glassmorphism were the response to the design trend pendulum swinging back from forced minimalism. The momentum here was just as big as when it was swinging the other way around — from Skeuomorphism all the way to functional minimalism of Material Design and Modern design trends.\r\nStages of design trends\r\n\r\n\r\nI’d say it takes about 7 years for a design trend to start reversing (give or take). The wooden backgrounds and stitched leather of the first iPhone (2007) gave way to minimal designs of iOS 7 (2013), and 2020 started bringing the real world, organic inspirations right back.\r\n\r\nWith both the usage of the frosted glass aesthetic (both Microsoft and Apple), skeuomorphic icons (Mac OS Big Sur update) people have generally reacted positively to the change.\r\n\r\nWe wanted the products we use to be “crafted” and have a soul, instead of being a utilitarian white-label from a design system (like Material Design).\r\n\r\nThere’s nothing wrong with minimalism, even in its extremes, but it does make everything blend together into a mass of sameness. The design diversity has been diminishing long enough. The users want change. The Android examples above just look boring in the most utilitarian way. Some would argue that that’s ok, that boring is good. But our lives are not about just accomplishing tasks on some to-do lists. We want to be delighted.\r\n\r\nThe new, skeuomorphic drive of all of these new trends also comes from the craft culture having a revival. Instead of another minimal, uninspiring IKEA table, we crave uneven wood that has a texture and a life for our homes. Same goes for wallets, backpacks, clothing, and more. We want the things we use to be “hand-crafted” rather than mass-produced.\r\n\r\nThe main problem with interfaces, however, is that they can’t really get too “funky”, or they’ll stop being functional. So how can we marry function with a form that looks beautiful and “organic”?\r\n\r\nYou know, just like the Northern Lights, which I think is a fitting name for this background type.\r\n\r\nIf the interface itself (the buttons, the fields, the labels) can’t really change that much, it’s up to the backgrounds to differentiate. This is the basic principle behind all the “morphisms” and this new Aurora style.\r\n\r\nUse the minimal design for everything that’s functional, and play around with ornamentation only. If done right, it also has the benefit of being accessible, because the actual interface — i.e. the things you use are accessible. So if someone can’t see some subtle background gradients, all they’d be missing is decoration.\r\n\r\nThis is also why I believe Neumorphism CAN be accessible if it’s just used for the cards and the cards have a proper hierarchy. Just don’t use it for text-fields, buttons and so on, and the contrast is going to be a non-issue.\r\n\r\nMixing “creative” backgrounds with minimal UI components is the best compromise between functionality and accessibility, but as with everything accessible it has to be done right.\r\n\r\n### Glassmorphism certified\r\n\r\nBefore we get to the backgrounds, it’s worth mentioning that this style works particularly well with Glassmorphism, and Apple knew it by creating a less blurred version of irregular color patterns as their main Big Sur wallpaper.\r\n\r\nApple and Microsoft are leading the way in exploring these new trends, but they’re not the only ones anymore.\r\n\r\n### How to start?\r\n\r\nYou can use your existing interface components with this style, as long as they have good enough contrasts, sizes and touch targets.\r\n\r\nThere are three main ways that you can use to create this effect.\r\n\r\n### Blurred shapes\r\n\r\nThe blurred shapes method is all about making irregular (preferably oval) shapes and then blurring them and mixing together to create an irregular gradient.\r\n\r\n### Multiple Gradient fills\r\n\r\nThis method is a mix of gradient fills (radial work best) with decreasing opacity towards the outer edge of the fill. Just drag the handles around to find the best mix. The more the transparent, outer-edge overlaps the more the colors will blend. You can also merge this method with the first one for something even more custom.\r\n",/n"Under normal circumstances, the majority of shows would take place within the grandiose setting of the Zaha Hadid–designed Dongdaemun Design Plaza which, while convenient, offers little room for designers to experiment with how their collections are presented. One silver lining to emerge this season, then, was the broader variety of backdrops, with designers exploring locations from the hallowed halls of the National Museum of Korea to the leafy environs of the Han Riverside Park, affording them the opportunity for more cohesive world-building alongside each collection. This mix of locations showcased more of what Seoul has to offer as a design capital, even from afar—something the week’s organizers would do well to continue with even when normality returns. \r\n\r\nThe highlights came by way of familiar faces such as the previously LVMH Prize-nominated Minju Kim, who showed off-schedule; more established Korean names like LIE; and a number of emerging talents, including Hanacha Studio and Painters. Together they made for an eclectic mix that reflects the rich patchwork of style scenes that have made Seoul a fashion capital.\r\n\r\nHere, find the five designers to know from Seoul Fashion Week’s fall 2021 season. \r\n\r\n##LIE\r\nAs one of the more established names on the Seoul Fashion Week schedule, designer Chung Chung Lee of LIE showed his collection in the colossal plaza outside the National Museum of Korea. It was a suitably epic setting for an outing that featured impeccably-cut and immediately desirable separates and outerwear. A number of particularly compelling pieces were inspired by horse riding, including a cropped, belted coat with a crossover shoulder detail and saddle-style leather bags dripping with tassels, buckles, and even stirrups. The most playful accessory? A riding crop. \r\n\r\n",/n"If you’re an Instagram user, you may have recently seen a pop-up asking if you want the service to “use your app and website activity” to “provide a better ads experience.” At the bottom there are two boxes: In a slightly darker shade of black than the pop-up background, you can choose to “Make ads less personalized.” A bright blue box urges users to “Make ads more personalized.”\r\n\r\nThis is an example of a dark pattern: design that manipulates or heavily influences users to make certain choices. Instagram uses terms like “activity” and “personalized” instead of “tracking” and “targeting,” so the user may not realize what they’re actually giving the app permission to do. Most people don’t want Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, to know everything they do and everywhere they go. But a “better experience” sounds like a good thing, so Instagram makes the option it wants users to select more prominent and attractive than the one it hopes they’ll avoid. \r\n\r\nThere’s now a growing movement to ban dark patterns, and that may well lead to consumer protection laws and action as the Biden administration’s technology policies and initiatives take shape. California is currently tackling dark patterns in its evolving privacy laws, and Washington state’s latest privacy bill includes a provision about dark patterns.\r\n\r\n“When you look at the way dark patterns are employed across digital engagement, generally, [the internet allows them to be] substantially exacerbated and made less visible to consumers,” Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, acting chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), told Recode. “Understanding the effect of that is really important to us as we craft our strategy for the digital economy.”\r\n\r\nDark patterns have for years been tricking internet users into giving up their data, money, and time. But if some advocates and regulators get their way, they may not be able to do that for much longer.\r\n### Dark patterns, briefly explained\r\n\r\nAlthough you may not have heard the term dark patterns before, you’ve surely seen countless examples of them — and experienced their effects:\r\n\r\n    The trial streaming service you signed up for, only to be automatically charged when the trial expired\r\n    The app interstitial ad you can’t figure out how to get out of because the “X” on the top right-hand corner is too small and faint to see ...\r\n    ... or the “X” is so small that you accidentally click on the ad itself and are redirected to the ad’s website\r\n    The drugstore account you have to create to get a vaccine appointment but can’t easily cancel\r\n    The marketing email that commands you to respond within the next five minutes or else, and includes a fake countdown timer\r\n    The big pop-up window urging you to sign up for a website’s newsletter with a big red “Sign Me Up” button, while the opt-out button is much smaller and passive-aggressively implies that anyone who clicks is a bad person who doesn’t care about saving money or staying informed\r\n\r\nBut there are also the effects that may not be as obvious. Dark patterns are used by websites to trick users into granting consent to being tracked, or having their data used in ways they didn’t expect and didn’t want. Or sites will claim they offer users ways to opt out of being tracked (usually because they legally have to do so), but use misleading language or make it especially difficult to actually do it.\r\n\r\nFor example: cookie consent pop-ups. Websites will tell you that their sites use cookies and then ask you to “accept” them, usually by clicking on a big, prominent, brightly colored icon. But if you want to refuse the cookies, you’ll have to search for and click through to a menu of settings and disable them manually. Most people don’t have the time or desire to do this for every single website they visit, if they even understand what’s being requested in the first place. Companies whose revenue relies heavily on user data don’t want to make it easy for those users to refuse to provide it.\r\n\r\nHarry Brignull coined the term “dark patterns” in 2010 and has been keeping tabs on them ever since on his website (he also wrote about them for The Verge back in 2013). Dark patterns existed in the physical world long before the internet came along: ’90s kids will remember the mail-order music club Columbia House’s amazing deal to buy 12 CDs for just one penny (plus shipping and handling), which then automatically opted them in to a CD-a-month club that was almost impossible to cancel. But the internet has made dark patterns so much more ubiquitous and powerful. Websites can refine their methods using the very specific feedback their visitors provide, optimizing their manipulation at a scale that the physical world could never in its wildest dreams achieve.\r\n\r\n“I think the internet has made it easier to industrialize the way in which we persuade and, in turn, manipulate and deceive each other,” Brignull told Recode.\r\n\r\nSome of the more obvious and scammy dark patterns — sneaking extra items into shopping baskets or tacking on hidden fees — have been made illegal in some places, and the FTC has gone after some of the most egregious offenders. But the law isn’t so cut and dried when it comes to privacy, data, and consent. \r\n\r\nIt’s hard to know what’s an actionable deceptive act or practice when there’s no privacy law in the first place. And it’s hard for consumers to know what they’re giving away unintentionally or how it might be used against them when it all happens behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n“It’s a bit like invisible health effects from breathing in fumes or getting a radiation dose: At the time, you might not realize it, but it has a hidden impact on you,” Brignull said. “With privacy, it’s quite difficult to think through and understand what the long-term implications are for you. You’re constantly leaking information about yourself to data brokers, and you don’t really know how they’re using it to market to you.”\r\n\r\nBecause of this, Brignull and a growing number of advocates, regulators, and lawmakers feel that legislation is necessary to stop these dark patterns so consumers can use the internet without constantly being manipulated into spending money, signing up for services they don’t need, or giving up their data.\r\n\r\n“Regulation works,” Brignull said. “It can really turn the internet into somewhere that’s nice to be instead of like a complete Wild West environment. And we need it.”\r\n### How laws and regulations can stop the worst dark patterns\r\n\r\nIf you live in California, you already have it. One of state Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s last acts before leaving office to run the Department of Health and Human Services was to add regulations around dark patterns to the state’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This banned dark patterns designed to make it difficult for consumers to exercise some of the rights that the law provides, like opting out of the sale of their data. Banned dark patterns include forcing users to click through multiple screens, scroll through lengthy privacy policies, urging them not to opt out, or using confusing language.\r\n\r\nWashington state’s third attempt to pass a privacy law, currently making its way through the legislature, says that dark patterns may not be used to obtain user consent to sell or share their data — a provision that was echoed in California’s recently passed Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), an expansion of its CCPA.\r\n\r\nFederal lawmakers are also paying attention to dark patterns. At a recent House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing about social media and disinformation, Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) asked Big Tech CEOs Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, and Jack Dorsey if they would oppose legislation that banned dark patterns that tricked users into giving away their data. This data, she said, was often used in algorithms that targeted people who are especially susceptible to misinformation.\r\n\r\n“Our children ... seniors, veterans, people of color, even our very democracy is at stake here,” Blunt Rochester said. “We must act. And we will assure you, we will act.”\r\n\r\nLate last year, the Congress member introduced the DETOUR (Deceptive Experience To Online Users Reduction) Act, the House version of the bill of the same name that Sens. Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Mark Warner (D-VA) introduced in 2019.\r\n\r\n“I introduced the DETOUR Act to address common tactics tech companies use that are used to get as much personal data as possible,” Blunt Rochester told Recode. “They are intentionally deceptive user interfaces that trick people into handing over their data.”\r\n\r\nThe bills target online services with more than 100 million monthly active users — Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, for example — and forbid them from designing user interfaces that manipulate users into consenting to give their personal data. The platforms also wouldn’t be able to run design change experiments on users without their consent.\r\n\r\nBlunt Rochester and Warner told Recode that they plan to reintroduce the DETOUR Act this session.\r\n\r\n“I’m committed to working with my colleagues in Congress to ban the use of these intentionally manipulative practices, designed to extract personal information from users,” Blunt Rochester said.\r\n\r\nSen. Fischer did not respond to a request for comment, but she rolled the DETOUR Act into the SAFE DATA Act, the Senate Commerce Committee Republicans’ version of a federal privacy law that they may reintroduce this session.\r\n\r\nFinally, the FTC, which would likely be in charge of regulating any legislation about dark patterns, is also taking a hard look at the practice.\r\n\r\n“This is a behavior we take seriously,” Slaughter, of the FTC, said.\r\n\r\nThe FTC plans to hold a workshop on the subject at the end of April, where it will discuss how dark patterns manipulate consumers, which groups may be especially vulnerable or harmed by this manipulation, what rules are in place to stop them, and if additional rules are needed and what they should be.\r\n\r\n“I think about this issue much more as one of data abuses than just data privacy,” Slaughter said. “The first step of collecting your data may not be the immediate harm. But how is that data then aggregated, used, transferred to manipulate your purchases, target advertising, create this surveillance economy that has a lot of downstream harms for users in a way that is less visible to the user or the public?”\r\n\r\nThe FTC’s authority here comes from its mandate to enforce laws against deceptive or unfair trade practices. The agency has gone after violators who use dark patterns where it can. Tricking people into signing up for and paying for subscriptions or services and intentionally making it difficult to cancel them is an obvious and actionable example. Making people think they’re buying something for a set price without making any additional charges clear is another one.\r\n\r\nOne of the few federal privacy laws we do have — the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act — gives the FTC authority over many privacy violations against children under 13, and many dark patterns are included in that law. But no such law exists for adults, so confusingly worded privacy policies and opt-outs that lead to data abuses may need legislation explicitly forbidding them before the FTC is empowered to act.\r\n\r\nThat legislation won’t be easy to write, either. The line between deliberate deception and legally urging a user to make a choice that materially benefits a company can be blurry.\r\n\r\n“Part of the challenge with regulating dark patterns are the gray areas: the instances where users of a technology are being constrained in such a way that they can’t exercise complete autonomy, but that they may not be experiencing full manipulation, or perhaps they are being coerced but with a light touch,” Jennifer King, privacy and data policy fellow at the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, told Recode.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of a federal privacy law, Slaughter says she hopes to use Section 18 of the FTC Act to exercise the commission’s rulemaking authority.\r\n\r\n“The FTC should have clearer, more direct Administrative Procedure Act rulemaking authority to address these kinds of things,” Slaughter said. “But in the meantime, I’m very excited to use all the tools that we have, including our Section 18 authority, to tackle it. Is it easy? No. Is it fast? No. Is it worth the effort? Yes. Because if we’re just waiting around for Congress to act, we could be waiting for a long time.” ",/n"Synthetic mRNA, the ingenious technology behind the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, might seem like a sudden breakthrough, or a new discovery. One year ago, almost nobody in the world knew what an mRNA vaccine was, for the good reason that no country in the world had ever approved one. Months later, the same technology powered the two fastest vaccine trials in the history of science.\r\n\r\nLike so many breakthroughs, this apparent overnight success was many decades in the making. More than 40 years had passed between the 1970s, when a Hungarian scientist pioneered early mRNA research, and the day the first authorized mRNA vaccine was administered in the United States, on December 14, 2020. In the interim, the idea’s long road to viability nearly destroyed several careers and almost bankrupted several companies.\r\n\r\nThe dream of mRNA persevered in part because its core principle was tantalizingly simple, even beautiful: The world’s most powerful drug factory might be inside all of us.\r\n\r\nRead: 3 ways the pandemic has made the world better\r\n\r\nPeople rely on proteins for just about every bodily function; mRNA—which stands for messenger ribonucleic acid—tells our cells which proteins to make. With human-edited mRNA, we could theoretically commandeer our cellular machinery to make just about any protein under the sun. You could mass-produce molecules that occur naturally in the body to repair organs or improve blood flow. Or you could request our cells to cook up an off-menu protein, which our immune system would learn to identify as an invader and destroy.\r\nIn the case of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, mRNA vaccines send detailed instructions to our cells to make its distinctive “spike protein.” Our immune system, seeing the foreign intruder, targets these proteins for destruction without disabling the mRNA. Later, if we confront the full virus, our bodies recognize the spike protein again and attack it with the precision of a well-trained military, reducing the risk of infection and blocking severe illness.\r\n\r\nBut mRNA’s story likely will not end with COVID-19: Its potential stretches far beyond this pandemic. This year, a team at Yale patented a similar RNA-based technology to vaccinate against malaria, perhaps the world’s most devastating disease. Because mRNA is so easy to edit, Pfizer says that it is planning to use it against seasonal flu, which mutates constantly and kills hundreds of thousands of people around the world every year. The company that partnered with Pfizer last year, BioNTech, is developing individualized therapies that would create on-demand proteins associated with specific tumors to teach the body to fight off advanced cancer. In mouse trials, synthetic-mRNA therapies have been shown to slow and reverse the effects of multiple sclerosis. “I’m fully convinced now even more than before that mRNA can be broadly transformational,” Özlem Türeci, BioNTech’s chief medical officer, told me. “In principle, everything you can do with protein can be substituted by mRNA.”\r\n\r\nIn principle is the billion-dollar asterisk. mRNA’s promise ranges from the expensive-yet-experimental to the glorious-yet-speculative. But the past year was a reminder that scientific progress may happen suddenly, after long periods of gestation. “This has been a coming-out party for mRNA, for sure,” says John Mascola, the director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “In the world of science, RNA technology could be the biggest story of the year. We didn’t know if it worked. And now we do.”\r\n1. The Long Road to Breakthrough\r\n\r\nFor more than 40 years, synthetic RNA couldn’t do anything useful. In 1978, Katalin Karikó was a young scientist at the Biological Research Centre in Szeged, Hungary, when she started working on the idea that it could. She left Hungary for the U.S. in the 1980s. At the University of Pennsylvania, she still struggled to design mRNA that the body did not immediately reject. When her research failed to attract the support of government grants and university colleagues, she was demoted.\r\n\r\nAfter a decade of fits and starts, Karikó and her research partner Drew Weissman finally broke through in the early 2000s. To sneak synthetic mRNA past the cell’s defenses, they realized that they had to tweak one of its molecular building blocks, the nucleosides that comprise a strand of RNA. “The solution, Karikó and Weissman discovered, was the biological equivalent of swapping out a tire,” the journalists Damian Garde and Jonathan Saltzman wrote for the science website Stat.\r\n\r\nGraeme Wood and David A. Spiegel: COVID-19 vaccines are coming, but they’re not what you think\r\n\r\nIn the U.S., the paper caught the attention of a brash group of postdoctoral researchers, professors, and venture capitalists. They started a company whose name smushed the words modified and RNA: Moderna. In Germany, Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, a married couple with a background in immunotherapy research, also saw huge potential. They founded several companies, including one to research mRNA-based treatments for cancer: BioNTech.\r\n\r\n“There was a lot of skepticism in the industry when we started, because this was a new technology with no approved products,” Türeci told me. “Drug development is highly regulated, so people don’t like to deviate from paths with which they have experience.” BioNTech and Moderna pressed on for years without approved products, thanks to the support of philanthropists, investors, and other companies. Moderna partnered with the NIH and received tens of millions of dollars from DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, to develop vaccines against viruses, including Zika. In 2018, Pfizer signed a deal with BioNTech to develop mRNA vaccines for the flu.\r\n\r\n“The technology initially appealed to us for the flu because of its great speed and flexibility,” Philip Dormitzer, who leads Pfizer’s viral-vaccines research and development programs, told me. “You can edit mRNA very quickly. That is quite useful for a virus like the flu, which requires two updated vaccines each year, for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.”\r\n\r\nBy the time the coronavirus outbreak shut down the city of Wuhan, China, Moderna and BioNTech had spent years fine-tuning their technology. When the outbreak spread throughout the world, Pfizer and BioNTech were prepared to shift immediately and redirect their flu research toward SARS-CoV-2. “It was really a case of our researchers swapping the flu protein for the coronavirus spike protein,” Dormitzer said. “It turned out that it wasn’t that big a leap.”\r\n\r\nArmed with years of mRNA clinical work that built on decades of basic research, scientists solved the mystery of SARS-CoV-2 with astonishing speed. On January 11, 2020, Chinese researchers published the genetic sequence of the virus. Moderna’s mRNA vaccine recipe was finalized in about 48 hours. By late February, batches of the vaccine had been shipped to Bethesda, Maryland, for clinical trials. Its development was accelerated by the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed, which invested billions of dollars in several vaccine candidates, including Moderna’s. With the perfect timing of a Hollywood epic, mRNA entered the promised land after about 40 wandering years of research. Scientific progress had proceeded at its typical two-speed pace—slowly, slowly, then all at once.\r\n2. Faster, Faster!\r\n\r\nSpeed and nimbleness were the qualities that first interested both DARPA and Pfizer in mRNA. And if the technology unlocks more breakthroughs after this pandemic, speed and nimbleness will play starring roles.\r\n\r\nMalaria kills more than 400,000 people every year, mostly young children. It is not caused by a virus or bacteria, but rather by an organism belonging to a separate phylum, called plasmodium. Plasmodia have a host of shape-shifting strategies to evade our immune systems. With most diseases, you catch it once and develop some protection going forward. But malaria shakes off our cellular defenses, making it possible to catch the disease over and over again. That also makes malaria hard to inoculate against: The only existing vaccine doesn’t work very well, even after a four-shot regimen.\r\n\r\nFrom the January/February 2021 issue: How science beat the virus\r\n\r\nLast month, a patent was approved for an RNA-based vaccine against malaria that showed promise in mice. “We’ve been working on this vaccine for years, but the entire landscape has changed in the last six months because of the success of COVID vaccines,” Richard Bucala, the vaccine’s co-inventor and a scientist at the Yale School of Medicine, told me.\r\n\r\nThe malaria vaccine uses self-amplifying RNA, or saRNA, which is subtly distinct from the mRNA technology used by Moderna and Pfizer. The vaccines against COVID-19 work by injecting up front all of the messenger RNA that you’re going to get. But self-amplifying RNA is designed to replicate itself inside our cells. This copy-paste function means, in theory, that each person needs only a tiny dose of vaccine to have a large immune response.\r\n\r\n“The replication function of saRNA is critical, because it’s not vaccines that prevent infection but vaccinations that prevent infection,” Bucala said. A miracle drug that’s not administered is no better than a worthless medicine that’s never approved. “The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines need a lot of mRNA, and it’s expensive to make, which is why it’s been slower to get to many countries outside the U.S.,” he went on. “With saRNA, we could inject one-hundredth of the material to have the same effect. That would make it easier to scale against a widespread disease.”\r\n\r\nThen there’s cancer. Scientists may never devise a single vaccine for cancer, because cancer is not a single disease but a constellation of more than 100 maladies, which we usually name for the place on the body where they originate. But what if we could respond to these hundreds of cancers with our own constellation of therapies that could train the body to attack a specific tumor?\r\n\r\nThis is the idea behind BioNTech’s cancer-immunotherapy research. It works something like this: For each cancer patient, BioNTech takes a tissue sample from a tumor to perform a genetic analysis. Based on that test, the company designs an individually tailored mRNA vaccine, which tells the patient’s cells to produce proteins associated with that specific tumor’s specific mutation. The immune system learns to search-and-destroy similar tumor cells throughout the body.\r\n\r\nThis cycle of analysis and design is not so different from the way BioNTech and Moderna swiftly analyzed Chinese scientists’ sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, identified the spike protein for attack, and made an effective therapy. “We hope that everything we’ve learned from COVID about producing and manufacturing mRNA can cross-fertilize the work on our off-the-shelf cancer treatments,” BioNTech’s Özlem Türeci told me. The company is currently in clinical trials for personalized vaccines in “basically every solid cancer,” she said, including melanoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. A 2021 analysis by University of North Carolina researchers in the journal Molecular Cancer pointed out that these cancer treatments have been slow to develop in recent years but that the COVID-19 breakthrough coincided with “promising” clinical trials in cancer vaccines. “We envision the rapid advancing of mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy in the near future,” they concluded.\r\n3. We Make Our Own Luck\r\n\r\nIn March 2020, Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine, didn’t think that mRNA technology would win the race against COVID-19. His bet was on the pharmaceutical company Merck, which had recently developed an astonishingly successful vaccine against Ebola using a modified livestock virus called vesicular stomatitis virus, or VSV. But Merck discontinued its COVID-19 vaccines when its promising new technology failed in clinical trials.\r\n\r\nHotez sees Merck’s failures as a critical lesson about science—and a cautionary tale about mRNA.“The technology that works for one epidemic might not work for the next one, and you won’t know what works until you try it,” he told me. “That’s why I say it’s too soon to call mRNA vaccines a miracle. They might not work against the next target.”\r\n\r\nEven mRNA’s biggest proponents concede the point. “This is not a magic bullet, and it’s not perfect for everything,” Pfizer’s Dormitzer told me. His partners at BioNTech concurred. “I do not claim that mRNA is the holy grail for everything,” Türeci said. “We are going to find that there are diseases where mRNA is surprisingly successful and diseases where it’s not. We have to prove it for each and every infectious disease, one by one.”\r\n\r\nmRNA may not produce a great second act in the next decade, or ever. Perhaps the scientific establishment will conclude that the technology benefited in the pandemic from a uniquely simple nemesis. “The coronavirus might be one of the easiest vaccine targets we’ve seen in modern times,” Hotez agreed. “Just about everything we’ve thrown at it has worked.”\r\n\r\nMaybe we got lucky. But luck is downstream from preparation. The coronavirus was an easy target only because science made it easy. Four years ago, following the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Arabian Peninsula and South Korea, 18 scientists from the NIH, Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College, and other institutions published a detailed examination of the shape and behavior of the coronavirus’s most notable feature: the spike protein. This paper decoded the mysteries and vulnerabilities of the virus long before anybody knew that this tiny pathogen would soon shut down the world. “Our studies,” they presciently concluded in their 2017 paper, “provide a foundation for the structure-based design of coronavirus vaccines.” Without this detective work, the mRNA breakthrough might not have happened.\r\n\r\nToday’s vaccines were forged from science’s successes, but also from its failures. For decades, researchers have struggled to design a workable vaccine for HIV, and many observers considered this field a dead end. But a new paper argues that these repeated failures forced HIV-vaccine researchers to spend a lot of time and money on strange and unproven vaccine techniques—such as synthetic mRNA and the viral-vector technology that powers the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Nearly 90 percent of COVID-19 vaccines that made it to clinical trials used technology that “could be traced back to prototypes tested in HIV vaccine trials,” Jeffrey E. Harris, the economist at MIT who authored the paper, wrote. He points out that if one HIV vaccine had succeeded, the company behind it would have won big. Instead, all of the competitors in the vaccine field learned from collective failure and contributed to collective wisdom. The many false starts of HIV vaccination sired an explosion of new technologies and helped usher in a possible new golden age of vaccines.\r\n4. The Tree of Progress\r\n\r\nWe can call our record-breaking vaccine-development process good luck. Or we can call it what it really is: a ringing endorsement for the essential role of science in the world.\r\n\r\n“Five years ago, we were in a state of ignorance about mRNA,” Mascola, of the NIH, told me. “And five years from now, we will learn that we are, at this very moment, in another state of ignorance. That’s why mRNA is such a beautiful scientific story. So many researchers, philanthropists, government organizations, and companies took a huge risk on a technology whose initial responses were marginal. And together, they figured out how to make it work.”\r\n\r\nAs a parable of scientific progress, I sometimes imagine the life cycle of a tree. Basic scientific research plants a variety of seeds. Some of these seeds fail entirely; the research goes nowhere. Some seeds become tiny shrubs; the research doesn’t fail entirely, but it produces little of value. And some seeds blossom into towering trees with abundant fruit that scientists, companies, and technologists pluck and turn into the products that change our lives. For years, mRNA technology looked like a shrub. In 2020, it blossomed in full view.\r\n\r\nYou cannot know in the early stages whether you’re planting a dud or a revolution. Even if it is a revolution, you cannot know what kind. Pfizer jumped into mRNA research for its potential to work against influenza, only to make history fighting a completely different virus. But this uncertainty risk is exactly why countries like the U.S. ought to encourage more basic science and highly novel research.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of mRNA, from backwater research to breakthrough technology, is not a hero’s journey, but a heroes’ journey. Without Katalin Karikó’s grueling efforts to make mRNA technology work, the world would have no Moderna or BioNTech. Without government funding and philanthropy, both companies might have gone bankrupt before their 2020 vaccines. Without the failures in HIV-vaccine research forcing scientists to trailblaze in strange new fields, we might still be in the dark about how to make the technology work. Without an international team of scientists unlocking the secrets of the coronavirus’s spike protein several years ago, we might not have known enough about this pathogen to design a vaccine to defeat it last year. mRNA technology was born of many seeds.",/n"There’s a growing argument, coming mostly from the left, that President Joe Biden’s foreign policy is essentially the same as former President Donald Trump’s.\r\n\r\nIt goes something like this: Two months into his administration, Biden is pursuing many of the same objectives as his predecessor. Sure, the tone has changed — namely, talk of rebuilding alliances and defending democracy and human rights — but much of the substance remains the same.\r\n\r\nFor example, Biden has taken an adversarial stance toward China and Russia; sold billions in weapons to a dictator in Egypt; kept the economic sanctions Trump imposed on Iran and the International Criminal Court (ICC) in place; declined to sanction Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his role in ordering the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi; and is unlikely to drastically slash the Pentagon budget.\r\n\r\nIn effect, they argue that US foreign policy right now is Trump’s with Bidenesque characteristics.\r\n\r\nThat critique is coming from a small but vocal chorus of analysts, activists, and noted commentators like Noam Chomsky. Stephen Miles, executive director of the progressive foreign policy group Win Without War, recently told Politico that “There’s this fear of being attacked on the right of not being tough enough on China or Iran or other issues.” The problem, he adds, is “there doesn’t seem to be as much concern about the overwhelming majority of the Democratic Party.”\r\n\r\nIt’s a provocative case, but it’s not very convincing. While there are some similarities between the two presidents, Biden and Trump have extremely different foreign policies. Any claims that they’re the same are incomplete at best.\r\n### The case for Biden’s foreign policy as the same as Trump’s, briefly explained\r\n\r\nIn December, I wrote a story about how Biden wanted the US to pursue a traditional, post-World War II foreign policy to defend the “liberal international order” — essentially the diplomatic and economic rules and norms that run the world. As Biden formed a team to do just that, progressives I interviewed couldn’t mask their displeasure.\r\n\r\n“Americans are looking for a complete, fundamental shift in US foreign policy,” Yasmine Taeb, a senior fellow at the progressive Center for International Policy who’s leading the left’s critique of Biden’s team, told me at the time. “I hope they recognize that the vast majority of the American people have rejected establishment foreign policy and the trajectory that we’ve been on for decades.”\r\n\r\nNow, Taeb and others are essentially saying, “I told you so.” They argue that two months into Biden’s presidency, it’s clear that “complete, fundamental shift in US foreign policy” hasn’t happened yet. What Americans have gotten instead is a Biden foreign policy that echoes Trump’s more than progressive critics like.\r\n\r\nTake Biden selling $200 million in missiles to Egypt, a country led by a dictator who has routinely violated human rights, jailing thousands of political dissidents and killing hundreds more. Biden’s detractors compare that to Trump’s decision to sell $8 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, even after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the 2018 murder of US resident Jamal Khashoggi.\r\n\r\nThey also point out that Biden’s team hasn’t lifted sanctions the Trump administration placed on the ICC. Trump took that action because the ICC was considering opening two investigations: one into alleged war crimes committed by US troops during the Afghanistan war, and one into alleged war crimes committed by Israelis and Palestinians during the 2014 Gaza War; the court was also considering making a determination on whether Israeli settlements in the West Bank constitute a war crime.\r\n\r\nTwo months in, Biden’s team has kept those sanctions in place. It’s not exactly clear why; when asked by reporters, the administration usually declines to comment. But Axios and the Guardian last month noted that Jerusalem is lobbying allies, including the US, to keep the financial pressure on the court in hopes that it will drop the case.\r\n\r\nThat rationale — that the Biden administration is keeping Trump’s sanctions on partly at Israel’s behest — tracks with comments some US officials have made.\r\n\r\n“We have serious concerns about the ICC’s attempts to exercise its jurisdiction over Israeli personnel,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a February statement. “The United States has always taken the position that the court’s jurisdiction should be reserved for countries that consent to it, or that are referred by the UN Security Council.”\r\n\r\nFor these and the other reasons cited above, critics say Biden’s foreign policy represents more continuity than change from the Trump years. That seems fair on the surface, but the truth is Biden’s foreign policy is nothing like Trump’s. Not even close.\r\nBiden and Trump are “a bit different” on foreign policy\r\n\r\n### Consider either what Biden has done or has said he wants to do on foreign policy:\r\n\r\n-    He rejoined the Paris climate agreement after Trump pulled the US out of it, and has made tackling climate change a top priority.\r\n-    He made the US a member of Covax, the global effort to fund and deliver Covid-19 vaccines around the world, which Trump didn’t do.\r\n-    He ended the “Muslim ban” that Trump put in place.\r\n-    He reversed Trump’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO).\r\n-    He ordered the US to rejoin the United Nations Human Rights Council after Trump took America out of it.\r\n-    He immediately extended the New START arms control pact with Russia for the maximum of five years, which the Trump administration didn’t want to do outright.\r\n-    He lifted the “foreign terrorist organization” designation off Yemen’s Houthis that the Trump administration imposed.\r\n-    He ended America’s support for offensive operations in the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\r\n-    He declined to make summitry with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un the centerpiece of his diplomatic strategy; Trump met with the dictator three times.\r\n-    He repeatedly expressed a desire to get the US back into the Iran nuclear deal after Trump withdrew the US from the pact.\r\n\r\nThere’s more, but it’s already notable that Biden and Trump just don’t see the world the same way. \r\n\r\nWhat’s more, Biden’s different tone — defending democracy and supporting human rights, among other things — is in itself a substantive policy change from the Trump years.\r\n\r\n“I made it clear that no American president [should] ever back down from speaking out of what’s happening to the Uyghurs, what’s happening in Hong Kong, what’s happening in-country,” Biden said during a press conference last week about his conversations with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\r\n\r\n“The moment a president walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world,” he continued. “It’s who we are.”\r\n\r\nBiden has followed through on his rhetoric by sanctioning Chinese officials for human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang and for cracking down on Hong Kong’s democracy.\r\n\r\nBut don’t take it from me or Biden. Trump administration officials also note the wide gap between the current president’s positions and the old one’s.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the list above didn’t just come from my head. It came from conversations with Trump-era staff who said US foreign policy would be “a bit different,” according to one, if the Republican had won a second term.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, they said the US wouldn’t have extended New START for five years, rejoined the WHO, lifted the terrorist label on the Houthis, or pushed for a return to the UN Human Rights Council.\r\n\r\nAnd already former Trump administration officials, like then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, are blasting Biden for pursuing a foreign policy built around defending democracy and human rights instead of pure national interests.\r\n\r\n“The central theme of President Biden’s foreign policy is a global, muscular liberalism,” he wrote in the Washington Post last week. “But it is not a sensible policy today,” he wrote, partly because the US is no longer the unquestioned global power.\r\n\r\nWhile he didn’t specifically mention Trump in the piece, he argued the more economic-focused course Trump took — “making sure we can determine our future free of external coercion and being able to trade and invest overseas on terms that promote a broad-based national prosperity” — would be better.\r\n\r\nSo no, Biden’s foreign policy isn’t nearly the same as Trump’s. But the meme persists, it seems, mostly because Biden has yet to return the US to the Iran nuclear deal.\r\n### How the Iran nuclear deal keeps the myth of Biden-as-Trump alive\r\n\r\nThose who argue Biden is pursuing a Trump-like foreign policy have one overriding complaint: that Biden hasn’t lifted Trump-imposed sanctions on Iran as a way to return swiftly to the nuclear pact — a decision praised by Jared Kushner, Trump’s senior adviser and son in law.\r\n\r\nBut Biden’s team says the situation isn’t as simple as progressives and Iran doves make it out to be. Tehran is in violation of the agreement, namely by enriching uranium at levels beyond caps outlined in the deal. Until the US can verify Iran has come back into compliance, there’s no reason to remove the economic leverage America has.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Biden’s team feels they inherited a bad situation. After Trump withdrew the US from the pact in 2018, Iran decided to violate the deal as a way to pressure the US back into the accord. Dropping the sanctions now, some in the new administration would say, rewards Tehran for no longer abiding by the nuclear deal’s terms.\r\n\r\nHence the delay. The US would “have to evaluate whether they were actually making good if they say they are coming back into compliance with their obligations, and then we would take it from there,” Secretary of State Tony Blinken said in his January confirmation hearing.\r\n\r\nBut even here there’s a yawning gap between how Trump and Biden handle the issue. The Trump administration wanted Iran to change nearly every aspect of its foreign policy before winning sanctions relief. Biden just wants Iran to abide by the nuclear pact again, and has even proposed partial sanctions removal for partial compliance.\r\n\r\nRyan Tully, who served as a top official on Trump’s National Security Council, confirmed his team would’ve pursued a different course. “We wouldn’t give sanctions relief to get to the negotiating table with Iran,” he told me.\r\n\r\nThe US may not be back in the nuclear deal, then, but it’s at least trying to get there. “Biden is offering Tehran a way out that doesn’t involve either its capitulation or collapse,” said Henry Rome, an expert on US policy toward Iran at the Eurasia Group consulting firm. “It’s a very different ballgame.”\r\n\r\n“A very different ballgame” goes not only for Biden’s Iran policy, but his entire foreign policy. There are clearly some similarities between the last two administrations — it’s been only two months, after all — but overall, they are vastly different.",/n"A blog (a truncation of \"weblog\")[1] is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual,[citation needed] occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, \"multi-author blogs\" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other \"microblogging\" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.\r\n\r\nThe emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer programming. Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. In the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.[2] In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.[3] However, there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.\r\n\r\nMany blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from philosophy, religion, and arts to science, politics, and sports. Others function as more personal online diaries or online brand advertising of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, digital images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. The ability of readers to leave publicly viewable comments, and interact with other commenters, is an important contribution to the popularity of many blogs. However, blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (art blogs), photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs or \"vlogs\"), music (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts). In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to as edublogs. Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.\r\n\r\n'Blog' and 'blogging' are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on social media, especially when the content is long-form and one creates and shares content on regular basis. So, one could be maintaining a blog on Facebook or blogging on Instagram.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, 2011, there were over 156 million public blogs in existence. On February 20, 2014, there were around 172 million Tumblr[4] and 75.8 million WordPress[5] blogs in existence worldwide. According to critics and other bloggers, Blogger is the most popular blogging service used today. However, Blogger does not offer public statistics.[6][7] Technorati lists 1.3 million blogs as of February 22, 2014.[8] ",/n"Lei Jun’s plan to join the increasingly crowded field of electric vehicle builders in China drew a muted reaction from the market on Wednesday as some analysts warned of the risks that lie ahead.\r\n\r\nShares of Lei’s smartphone maker Xiaomi finished the day with a modest gain of 0.6%, after the company said Tuesday evening that it plans to invest about $10 billion into manufacturing electric cars over the next decade. Lei said Xiaomi would pursue the plan through a wholly owned subsidiary, which he described as his last major startup project.\r\n\r\n“I will personally oversee this [EV business],” the billionaire said. “I look forward to the future where there is a Xiaomi car running on every road globally.”\r\n\r\nThe company’s news release effectively confirms a rumor about a possible EV venture that had surfaced earlier this year. Xiaomi’s core business is selling smartphones, more than 60% of last year’s 245.9 billion yuan ($37.4 billion) came from its phone unit. But the market for smartphones has been shrinking. Market research firm Canalys says smartphone shipments worldwide stood at 1.26 billion units in 2020, down 7% from a year earlier partly due to the impact of the pandemic.\r\n\r\n\r\nXiaomi Celebrates 10th Anniversary In Beijing\r\n\r\nXiaomi CEO Lei Jun gives a public speech for Xiaomi's 10th anniversary on August 11, 2020 in ...

Xiaomi’s core business is selling smartphones, more than 60% of last year’s 245.9 billion yuan ($37.4 billion) came from its phone unit. But the market for smartphones has been shrinking. Market research firm Canalys says smartphone shipments worldwide stood at 1.26 billion units in 2020, down 7% from a year earlier partly due to the impact of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nXiaomi is currently the world’s fourth-largest smartphone maker with a market share of 12%, Canalys data shows. Lei, who derives the majority of his wealth from his stake in the company, has a net worth of $24 billion, making him the 13th richest person in China, according to Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaire’s List. Aside from a shrinking market, the billionaire also recently had to tangle with the U.S. government. A federal judge in March ordered a temporary halt to a U.S government ban that blocked Americans from investing in the company, which had sent Xiaomi shares plunging 10% when it was announced in January.\r\n\r\nAnalysts say electric cars could present a new growth opportunity. Chinese consumers are increasingly attracted by the sleekly designed models, which often have autonomous driving features and can be remotely controlled to stream music or video via in-car displays. This year, China’s sales of electric vehicles is expected to climb to 1.9 million units, a jump of 51% from a year earlier, according to Canalys. \r\n\r\n“Internet companies may think they have an advantage because cars are getting increasingly intelligent, and are being compared to computers on four wheels,” says Yale Zhang, an analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. “But making cars is a huge risk, and nobody knows whether Xiaomi’s venture will be successful or not.”\r\n\r\nZhang pointed to the boom-to-bust cycle that China’s EV market experienced just a couple years ago, when hundreds of startups had been seeking to gain a foothold in a growing market. But as government subsidies were phased out and funding dried up, only a handful managed to survive.\r\n\r\nLei said on Tuesday that he made the decision to venture into EVs after careful evaluation and research that began in mid-January. “We are fully aware of the risks involved,” he said. “We are also aware the project will require billions in investment, and likely take at least 3-5 years before we see any return.\"\r\n\r\nA Xiaomi spokesperson said the company had no additional comment at this stage, including how it would manufacture the cars and when it would launch the first model. The company had previously dismissed via China’s Twitter-equivalent Sina Weibo reports that it would make cars using Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor’s factory.\r\n\r\nLei had previously dabbled in the EV industry. Shunwei Capital, a venture capital firm he cofounded in 2011, counts Chinese electric car companies Nio and Xpeng among its portfolio, according to its website. It also invested in Momenta, an autonomous driving startup that had a valuation of $1 billion after a 2018 funding round.",/n"# Backend Architecture\r\n\r\nSoftware engineers seem to always be discussing the front-end and the backend of their apps. But what exactly does this mean?\r\n\r\nThe front-end is the code that is executed on the client side. This code (typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) runs in the user’s browser and creates the user interface.\r\n\r\nThe backend is the code that runs on the server, that receives requests from the clients, and contains the logic to send the appropriate data back to the client. The backend also includes the database, which will persistently store all of the data for the application. This article focuses on the hardware and software on the server-side that make this possible.\r\n\r\nReview HTTP and REST if you want to refresh your memory on these topics. These are the main conventions that provide structure to the request-response cycle between clients and servers.\r\n\r\nLet’s start by reviewing the client-server relationship, and then we can start to put the pieces all together!\r\n### What are the clients?\r\n\r\nThe clients are anything that send requests to the backend. They are often browsers that make requests for the HTML and JavaScript code that they will execute to display websites to the end user. However, there are many different kinds of clients: they might be a mobile application, an application running on another server, or even a web enabled smart appliance.\r\n### What is a backend?\r\n\r\nThe backend is all of the technology required to process the incoming request and generate and send the response to the client. This typically includes three major parts:\r\n\r\n    The server. This is the computer that receives requests.\r\n    The app. This is the application running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from the database, and sends a response.\r\n    The database. Databases are used to organize and persist data.\r\n\r\n### What is a server?\r\n\r\nA server is simply a computer that listens for incoming requests. Though there are machines made and optimized for this particular purpose, any computer that is connected to a network can act as a server. In fact, you will often use your very own computer as server when developing apps.\r\nWhat are the core functions of the app?\r\n\r\nThe server runs an app that contains logic about how to respond to various requests based on the HTTP verb and the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The pair of an HTTP verb and a URI is called a route and matching them based on a request is called routing.\r\n\r\nSome of these handler functions will be middleware. In this context, middleware is any code that executes between the server receiving a request and sending a response. These middleware functions might modify the request object, query the database, or otherwise process the incoming request. Middleware functions typically end by passing control to the next middleware function, rather than by sending a response.\r\n\r\nEventually, a middleware function will be called that ends the request-response cycle by sending an HTTP response back to the client.\r\n\r\nOften, programmers will use a framework like Express or Ruby on Rails to simplify the logic of routing. For now, just think that each route can have one or many handler functions that are executed whenever a request to that route (HTTP verb and URI) is matched.\r\nWhat kinds of responses can a server send?\r\n\r\nThe data that the server sends back can come in different forms. For example, a server might serve up an HTML file, send data as JSON, or it might send back only an HTTP status code. You’ve probably seen the status code “404 - Not Found” whenever you’ve tried navigating to a URI that doesn’t exist, but there are many more status codes that indicate what happened when the server received the request.\r\n### What is a database, and why do we need to use them?\r\n\r\nDatabases are commonly used on the backend of web applications. These databases provide an interface to save data in a persistent way to memory. Storing the data in a database both reduces the load on the main memory of the server CPU and allows the data to be retrieved if the server crashes or loses power.\r\n\r\nMany requests sent to the server might require a database query. A client might request information that is stored in the database, or a client might submit data with their request to be added to the database.",/n"# Algorithm, Design and Analysis [Asymptomatic Notations]\r\n\r\n#### What is an algorithm?\r\n\r\nIt's a finite set of steps to solve a problem.\r\n\r\nTwo types:\r\n- Priori : Analysis done before execution\r\n- Prosteriori : Analysis done after execution\r\n\r\n#### Asymptomatic Notations\r\n- Big O (worst case)\r\n- Big Omega (best case)\r\n- Theta (average case)\r\n\r\nSo every function can be written/represented in these big O, Big omega, theta notations.\r\n\r\n##### BIG O Eg:\r\nf(n)= 2n<sup>2</sup> + 2\r\n\t\twhich is lesser than equal to \t\t\tc.g(n<sup>2</sup>)\r\nYou gotta put in the higher exponential function, i.e, the **n<sup>2</sup>**.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow for the second part, it's obvious, **2n<sup>2</sup> + n** is obvio gonna be  more than just *2n<sup>2</sup>* but less than **2n<sup>2</sup>**\r\n\r\n##### BIG Omega Eg:\r\n\r\n\r\n|||<sup>ly</sup> the same applies to this example. \r\n\r\n##### BIG Theta Eg:\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah you get it\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## Their Various Properties:\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall O : use n<sup>3</sup>\r\nSmall Omega : use n\r\n\r\n",/n
