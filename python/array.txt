"The race to fill retiring Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman's Senate seat currently features one unofficial candidate and two official ones: a person flirting with QAnon-style conspiracy theories, someone whose Twitter account was recently suspended because of bigoted tweets, and a third person who's calling for Rep. Anthony Gonzalez's (R-OH) resignation simply because he voted to impeach then-President Trump.\r\n![Jane Timken speaks into a microphone.](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JKvHNcfpKEUurfs9GxGhc-hxCYI=/0x0:2048x1536/1200x800/filters:focal(835x612:1161x938)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029684/822876478.0.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf this primary serves as a window into what the Republican Party will look like heading into the 2022 midterms, it's not a pretty picture --- and one dominated by the divisive, conspiratorial politics favored by Trump. Other midterm races are still taking shape, but in Ohio, it's becoming clear that Trump's hold on the party is firmer than ever.\r\n\r\nPortman announced his retirement in late January, [saying](https://www.timesgazette.com/news/54276/portman-on-not-seeking-re-election-its-harder-to-break-through-the-partisan-gridlock-and-make-progress) \"it has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision.\" He did his best to avoid talking about Trump during the second of his two terms in the Senate, going as far as to claim he didn't read his incendiary tweets during national television appearances.\r\n\r\nWhile never exactly a Trump ally, Portman was largely supportive of the former president's agenda, though he was [mildly critical](https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-statement-2020-presidential-election) of Trump's efforts to overturn the election results.\r\n\r\nPortman did his best to pretend Trump didn't exist, but the candidates running to be his successor are employing the opposite strategy: The race to fill his seat looks increasingly like a competition to see which candidate can talk about Trump the most.\r\n\r\n### [**Sign up for The Weeds newsletter**](http://www.vox.com/weeds-newsletter)\r\n\r\nVox's German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration's unprecedented burst of policymaking. [Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday](http://vox.com/weeds-newsletter).\r\n\r\n### J.D. Vance has gone full Tucker Carlson\r\n\r\nThe QAnon-curious figure in the race is J.D. Vance, author of the bestselling memoir *Hillbilly Elegy*, which was released in June 2016 and was \"praised [by some publications](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2016/08/17/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-donald-trump-usa-today-best-selling-books-book-buzz/88862854/) as a skeleton key to Trumpism,\" as my colleague Alissa Wilkinson recently [put it](https://www.vox.com/culture/21547861/hillbilly-elegy-review-netflix) in her review of the film adaptation of the book.\r\n\r\n*Hillbilly Elegy* detailed the cultural milieu in which support for a populist demagogue like Trump could thrive. But Vance didn't try to hide the fact that he wasn't a Trump fan during the 2016 campaign, [saying](https://thebulwark.com/j-d-vance-joins-the-jackals/), \"I can't stomach Trump. I think that he's noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place.\"\r\n\r\nBut now that Trump has made it nearly impossible to function in Republican politics without unyielding support for him --- recent [polling](https://morningconsult.com/2021/02/16/trump-gop-support-impeachment-poll/) indicates a majority of Republicans would support him in a hypothetical 2024 Republican primary --- the 36-year-old Vance is singing a different tune.\r\n\r\nIn recent months, Vance has approvingly retweeted the likes of Donald Trump Jr. and Dinesh D'Souza; done softball interviews with Tucker Carlson and far-right former Trump administration official [Seb Gorka](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/8/25/15505180/sebastian-gorka-out-resign); tweeted Trump-style attacks on the media (for instance [asking](https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1361525600888963072), \"Why are so many members of the press such incredible babies?\"); and promoted a [QAnon](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/1/17253444/qanon-trump-conspiracy-theory-4chan-explainer)-inspired conspiracy theory by suggesting a group of unrelated sexual misconduct cases is evidence of a cabal.\r\n\r\n\"Someone should have asked Jeffrey Epstein, John Weaver, or Leon Black about the CRAZY CONSPIRACY that many powerful people were predators targeting children,\" Vance tweeted on February 11.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that Vance has expressed interest in policy, his platform has largely centered on immigration restrictionism, complaining about Trump being banished from Facebook and Twitter, calling out alleged liberal hypocrisy, and trying to make hay out of Trumpist culture war wedge issues like the supposed cancelation of Dr. Seuss.\r\n\r\nIn short, Vance has gone full Tucker Carlson.\r\n\r\nVance hasn't officially entered the Ohio Senate race yet, but he already has a super PAC supporting him called Protect Ohio Values that recently [received $10 million](https://www.vox.com/recode/22332045/peter-thiel-jd-vance-ohio-senate-donation) from tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel.\r\n\r\nVance's brand of Trumpism isn't necessarily as stark as that of the other two candidates in the race --- though he's only posted 98 tweets, just one of them mentions Trump by name. But his soft-pedaling of conspiracy theories, embrace of conspiracy theorists, focus on stoking division with culture war grievances, and attacks on the \"[elites](https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1373662583975215106)\" (despite his Yale Law School background) indicates whatever reservations he once had about Trumpism have fallen by the wayside.\r\n\r\n### The other two candidates are working even harder for Trump's endorsement\r\n\r\nThe two candidates who have officially launched campaigns to replace Portman are former Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel and former Ohio GOP chair Jane Timken. And, like Vance, neither of them has exactly bathed themselves in glory so far.\r\n\r\nMandel's Twitter account was recently restricted for \"hateful conduct,\" as the Cincinnati Enquirer [explains](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/18/twitter-temporarily-blocks-ohio-senate-candidate-josh-mandel-over-hateful-conduct/4755165001/):\r\n\r\n> Mandel's account created a poll [on March 18] about which type of \"illegals\" would commit more crimes, \"Muslim Terrorists\" or \"Mexican Gangbangers.\" His campaign later shared that the account was temporarily suspended for 12 hours for violating Twitter's policies on \"hateful conduct.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Mandel's tweet was racist in multiple respects, he's unrepentant. After his account was unrestricted, he posted a tweet claiming, \"Just like President Trump, I was canceled by @twitter @jack yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wear this as a badge of honor as Big Tech thugs & elites target those who they are most afraid of,\" he added. \"Our movement of steel-spined Constitutional Conservatives & Trump Warriors will not be silenced.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond Trump-style bigotry, Mandel's platform largely seems to be that he loves Trump more than anyone else. His Twitter bio boasts that he was the \"1st Statewide Official in Ohio to support President Trump.\" When he officially launched his campaign on February 10, he said he's \"going to Washington to fight for President Trump's America First Agenda.\"\r\n\r\nBut all this fawning over Trump apparently hasn't been enough to give Mandel pole position for Trump's endorsement. That distinction reportedly belongs to Timken, whom Trump wanted to endorse before being talked out of it late last month on the grounds that doing so would be premature, according to [Axios](https://www.axios.com/trump-endorsement-ohio-senate-2022-d7ef0b0d-c993-485f-af08-1990ed6fdd11.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_content=politics-trumpmidterms).\r\n\r\nTimken made headlines a few weeks ago for calling on her Congress member, Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, to resign. Gonzalez was one of 10 House Republicans to vote for Trump's impeachment.\r\n\r\n\"President Trump is the leader of our Party and we must have conservative leaders committed to the team if we are going to keep Ohio red and win back majorities in the U.S. House and Senate in 2022,\" Timken said in a statement. \"Gonzalez should put his constituents and the Republican Party first by resigning from Congress.\"\r\n\r\nBut Timken gave very different comments about Gonzalez before she announced her campaign in February, with her later remarks apparently an indication of what she thinks it'll take to win the race.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to Cleveland.com, Timken [praised](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/02/will-the-ohio-gop-move-on-from-trump-a-qa-with-chairman-jane-timken.html) Gonzalez, describing him as \"a very effective legislator\" and \"a very good person.\" That interview was conducted after the impeachment vote, so the only thing that changed between then and the statement Timken released calling for Gonzalez's resignation is that she announced she's running for office.\r\n\r\n### The Ohio race is playing out just the way Trump wants it to\r\n\r\nTrump's decisive loss in November to Biden and subsequent campaign to overturn the result --- an effort lowlighted by the [January 6 insurrection](https://www.vox.com/22220746/trump-speech-incite-capitol-riot) at the US Capitol --- provided the Republican Party with its latest opportunity to turn the page from Trumpism. But, as has repeatedly been the case since Trump won the Republican primary in 2016, the party refused to take it.\r\n\r\nA total of 17 Republicans in the House and Senate voted for Trump's impeachment or removal in connection with the insurrection. But those Republicans were quickly ostracized from the more powerful MAGA faction of the party. For instance, Trump loyalist Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) traveled to Wyoming to give a speech denouncing House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney (WY) for her yes vote for impeachment, and Trump denounced Republicans who voted against him by name to applause during his February speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, which doubled as [a weekend-long celebration of all things Trump](https://www.vox.com/2021/2/28/22306318/trump-cpac-2021-speech-election-lies).\r\n\r\nIt's more than just rhetoric. Trump is [attempting a hostile takeover](https://www.vox.com/22321215/trump-rnc-cease-and-desist-fundraising-feud-purge) of the GOP by asking his supporters to donate to him instead of the Republican National Committee (RNC) and other prominent Republican groups. He's also made clear that he thinks \"RINOS\" (Republicans in name only) like Gonzalez who supported his impeachment should be purged from the party.\r\n\r\nAnd Trump has already [endorsed](https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/politics/elections/candidates/former-president-trump-max-miller-gop-primary-northeast-ohio-rep-anthony-gonzalez/95-f3423394-209b-4726-91e4-f37b8e6afa62) the candidacy of Max Miller, a former White House aide of his who is primarying Gonzalez.\r\n\r\n### This is partly a story about Ohio, but mostly one about the Republican Party\r\n\r\nOhio is traditionally thought of as a purple, bellwether state, but it has been trending redder since 2012, when then-President Barack Obama carried the state with a slim majority.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Trump easily won there, besting Hillary Clinton by more than 8 percentage points. But Trump's margin looked downright slim compared to Portman's, who won reelection by more than 20 percentage points over Democratic ex-Gov. Ted Strickland. Trump again carried Ohio easily last November, beating Biden by about the same margin as he beat Clinton four years earlier.\r\n\r\nThis isn't to say that Democrats can no longer win in Ohio. The other US senator from the state, Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown, won reelection for his third term in 2018 over ex-Rep. Jim Renacci by a comfortable margin of about 7 percentage points. But all else being equal, whoever prevails in the Republican primary --- particularly if they have Trump's blessing --- will likely be the favorite to fill Portman's seat.\r\n\r\nUltimately, however, the story of the primary to replace Portman is more about the direction of the Republican Party than it is about Ohio. The defining issue of the race is Trump --- how much a candidate supports him, whether he has endorsed them, and how like him they are. Losing reelection and presiding over the GOP's loss of both chambers of Congress wasn't enough to shake his hold on the party.",/n"<iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K3odScka55A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nThree different Covid-19 vaccines are now being distributed across the United States, and all three are highly effective at the most important thing: preventing hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19. But some people remain worried that Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is less effective at preventing disease to begin with.\r\n\r\nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan this week turned down 6,200 Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses for his city. “Johnson & Johnson is a very good vaccine. Moderna and Pfizer are the best,” Duggan said in a news conference. “And I am going to do everything I can to make sure that residents of the city of Detroit get the best.”\r\n\r\nScientists say that this is the wrong way to think about Covid-19 vaccines, and that judging the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as inferior based on its lower reported efficacy is misleading.\r\n\r\nSuch actions are especially worrying at the current stage of the pandemic. Covid-19 has killed more than 500,000 Americans, and while cases seem to be declining, the virus is still spreading, new variants are gaining ground, and some parts of the country are already relaxing precautions (which health officials warn could end up prolonging the pandemic).\r\n\r\nTurning down vaccine doses while supplies of all Covid-19 vaccines are still stretched thin undermines the campaign to curb the pandemic.\r\n\r\nIn clinical trials, the vaccines produced by Pfizer/BioNTech, by Moderna, and by Johnson & Johnson reduced the fatality rate of Covid-19 by 100 percent compared to their placebo groups. They also kept all recipients out of the hospital. That means they can potentially downgrade Covid-19 from a public health crisis to a manageable problem.\r\n\r\n“The goal of a vaccine was really to defang or tame this virus, to make it more like other respiratory viruses that we deal with, so when you look at the three approved vaccines in the US, all of them are extremely good at that metric,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\r\n\r\nThe vaccines do have some important differences. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is one dose, while the others require two. It also can be stored at refrigerator temperatures, while the others require freezer temperatures. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is also less expensive, about $10 per dose, roughly half as much as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The Moderna vaccine costs between $25 and $37 per dose.\r\n\r\nThese factors give Johnson & Johnson an edge in logistics and could help the shots get to people in harder-to-reach places. Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told Vox last month that it’s a vaccine that “can increase equity.”\r\n\r\nBut when Johnson & Johnson filed for an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for its Covid-19 vaccine in early February, it reported that its overall efficacy in preventing Covid-19 cases that produced symptoms was 66.1 percent. The Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines reported efficacy levels around 95 percent.\r\n\r\nThat gap in efficacy numbers is fueling some people’s perception that the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine isn’t as good. However, scientists say that these numbers can’t be fairly compared to one another. The efficacy levels of the Covid-19 vaccines are specific to the clinical trials that produced them, and those trials were not conducted in the same ways.\r\n\r\nIn addition, health officials have been emphasizing that the most important numbers — how well the vaccines prevent hospitalizations and deaths — are consistent across the board and are arguably more comparable. Even after these vaccines have begun distribution, researchers are finding that Covid-19 vaccines are doing a remarkable job of keeping people alive.\r\n\r\nThat’s why the recommendation remains that the best Covid-19 vaccine for the vast majority of people is the first one they can get. “That’s how I think of these vaccines, as basically interchangeable,” said Adalja.\r\n\r\n### Why it’s hard to make direct comparisons between the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine and the ones from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech\r\n\r\nTo gauge how well vaccines work, companies test them in several stages, looking to ensure they are safe, to find the correct dose, and to figure out how much protection they provide. These trials are designed to test vaccines individually, not to pit them against each other. So direct comparisons don’t always make sense, and one has to be careful to understand the nuances of how each result was obtained.\r\n\r\nBut health officials have acknowledged that the earlier results of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines shifted expectations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\r\n\r\n“If this had occurred in the absence of a prior announcement and implementation of a 94, 95 percent efficacy [vaccine], one would have said this is an absolutely spectacular result,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine during the press conference in January.\r\n\r\nIn phase 3 clinical trials, Covid-19 vaccines were tested against the virus in the real world, in actual people against the actual virus. This involves testing tens of thousands of participants to see who ends up showing symptoms, randomly dividing them into groups that receive the actual vaccine and groups that receive a placebo (without revealing who got what).\r\n\r\nTesting in the real world means dealing with all the confounding factors of the real world. Depending on which volunteers are selected and where they are, they face different infection rates of the virus. They have varying access to health care. Some places had stricter lockdowns than others, or started them at varying times, so participants experienced different public health measures. Michigan issued a mask mandate in March 2020 while California issued one in June 2020, for example.\r\n\r\nTiming is critical too. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech studies finished enrolling participants in their phase 3 trials in October and reported their results in late November. The Johnson & Johnson phase 3 trial only finished enrolling participants in December 2020 and reported their results in January.\r\n\r\nThat means the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was tested during one of the most severe stages of the pandemic, when transmission, cases, and hospitalizations were at their worst in many places around the world, including the US. The trial also captured efficacy against the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) which began circulating at this point in some parts of the world. Several of these variants have shown themselves to be more contagious, deadlier, and more likely to evade protection from vaccines and prior immunity.\r\n\r\nAnd Johnson & Johnson’s efficacy results included trials in other countries, whereas the results from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech were mainly from US-based participants.\r\n\r\nJohnson & Johnson found that vaccine efficacy shifted depending on the country in which it was studied. The vaccine was found to have a 72 percent overall efficacy after four weeks in preventing Covid-19 symptoms in the US. Under the same benchmarks in South Africa, where a coronavirus variant with worrisome mutations that help it escape vaccines has been spreading widely, the company found a 64 percent efficacy.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to preventing severe and critical cases of Covid-19, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 85.9 percent efficacious in the US, while in South Africa, efficacy against severe and critical disease was reduced to 81.7 percent.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these vaccines were tested in different ways at different times is why it’s so hard to make apples-to-apples comparisons. “I don’t even look at those efficacy numbers and compare them head-to-head like that,” Adalja said. “Biostats 101: You cannot compare trial results like that unless they were done in a head-to-head fashion.”\r\n\r\n### Researchers still need more information about Covid-19 vaccines, especially as new variants spread\r\n\r\nThe huge emphasis on the fact that vaccines prevent hospitalizations and death doesn’t mean that preventing the symptoms of Covid-19 is not important. Millions of people in the US have preexisting health conditions and could suffer from the disease even if they don’t end up in the hospital. About 10 percent of Covid-19 survivors have reported persistent symptoms even after the virus has faded away, the so-called long haulers. It hints that the disease can cause long-term damage.\r\n\r\nAnd while vaccines can protect an individual, it’s less clear how well they prevent transmission from person to person (although evidence is mounting that the available Covid-19 vaccines reduce the virus’ spread). That’s why vaccinated people are encouraged to continue wearing masks until vaccinations are widespread.\r\n\r\nAn ideal Covid-19 vaccine would reduce deaths, hospitalizations, symptoms, and transmission, and right now, all of the three Covid-19 vaccines available in the US check these boxes, even for people with risk factors for severe disease or long-term illness.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t be picky if I’m a high-risk person, because being picky may leave you out in the cold of not being vaccinated,” said Lawrence Corey, a professor studying virology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. “We have still an incredible epidemic going on here.”\r\n\r\nThere are some people with a history of severe allergic reactions or certain immunological conditions who will have to be careful about selecting a vaccine, and some may not be able to receive one at all. But that makes it all the more important to vaccinate everyone around a vulnerable person, which helps build herd immunity.\r\n\r\nThe looming concern, though, is how well Covid-19 vaccines will hold up as the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to mutate and new variants arise. Already, vaccine manufacturers are investigating booster doses and modifications of their shots to better counter the newer versions of the virus.\r\n\r\nResearchers will also have to figure out how well existing vaccines are holding up against the variants in the real world. While vaccine clinical trials were conducted independently of each other, it would behoove scientists to coordinate from here on out, sharing protocols and pooling data to draw more useful conclusions.\r\n\r\n“Imagine what will happen when these studies generate results, each with their own populations, eligibility criteria, validation procedures and clinical endpoints,” wrote Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, in Nature. “If we don’t want our final answers to be a jumble, we must act now to consider how data can be compared and combined.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it’s important to keep in mind that vaccines are one part of a comprehensive public health response to Covid-19. Social distancing, hand-washing, mask-wearing, testing, tracing, and isolation remain critical to speeding up progress toward the end of the pandemic.

Foreigners transferring to the US offices of their multinational companies through L visas, including business executives, and some scholars and people participating in cultural and work exchanges on J-1 visas, were also banned.\r\n\r\nAlthough Trump administration officials argued, at the time the ban was instituted, that it would save 525,000 American jobs, most of the layoffs ultimately occurred in industries that do not employ a significant number of foreign workers coming on visas. This suggests that the ban did little to lower unemployment and could have harmed companies that employ both Americans and noncitizens.\r\n\r\nThe ban always excluded immigrants who are already in the US, existing visa holders, temporary workers in food production industries, and health care workers and researchers fighting Covid-19.\r\n\r\n### It might be a while longer before visa processing returns to normal\r\n\r\nAlthough Biden is allowing the ban to sunset, many foreign workers are still facing pandemic-related travel bans for most of Europe, Brazil, China, Iran, and South Africa and are still barred from entering the US.\r\n\r\nEven those who are now eligible to enter the US could face additional months of waiting before their visa applications are processed. Consulates abroad where visa interviews are conducted still aren’t fully operational due to the pandemic. They also haven’t been bringing in enough revenue, since their budgets rely in part on fees from visa applicants.\r\n\r\nWith limited resources, consulates are prioritizing applications for people seeking to immigrate to the US permanently, as opposed to those on temporary worker visas. The State Department said that, as of February, there was an extensive backlog of 473,000 such applicants — and that number even excludes cases where applicants haven’t had an interview or are still pulling together the required documents.\r\n\r\nThe State Department has taken steps to speed up processing, including announcing that it will waive interviews for people who were previously issued a visa in the same category in the recent past. But Dalal-Dheini said that officials should also consider additional interview waivers, automatic extensions of visas that may have expired while immigrants couldn’t enter the US, and revalidating visas for people already in the US without them having to leave the country.\r\n\r\nFor some foreign workers, however, the waiting game might be too long.\r\n\r\n“People aren’t going to be able to sit around and wait for the policies to be overturned and the processes to catch up when there’s opportunity to go elsewhere,” Dalal-Dheini said. “They’ll go elsewhere. Or, as the pandemic has proven, people can work from wherever, so don’t have to come to the US.” \r\nTrump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump",/n"UI design and especially its more artistic, visual side is constantly evolving. While most current products repeat the same, trusted and well-known IA patterns, UI and the Value Proposition are the biggest differentiators the product can have.\r\n\r\nNobody is going to try and redesign a registration process that works well in thousands of other apps — we’ll tweak it, for sure, and hopefully with some research, but in the end, it will just be a copy of what the users already know.\r\n### All the morphisms\r\n\r\nBoth Neumorphism and Glassmorphism were the response to the design trend pendulum swinging back from forced minimalism. The momentum here was just as big as when it was swinging the other way around — from Skeuomorphism all the way to functional minimalism of Material Design and Modern design trends.\r\nStages of design trends\r\n\r\n\r\nI’d say it takes about 7 years for a design trend to start reversing (give or take). The wooden backgrounds and stitched leather of the first iPhone (2007) gave way to minimal designs of iOS 7 (2013), and 2020 started bringing the real world, organic inspirations right back.\r\n\r\nWith both the usage of the frosted glass aesthetic (both Microsoft and Apple), skeuomorphic icons (Mac OS Big Sur update) people have generally reacted positively to the change.\r\n\r\nWe wanted the products we use to be “crafted” and have a soul, instead of being a utilitarian white-label from a design system (like Material Design).\r\n\r\nThere’s nothing wrong with minimalism, even in its extremes, but it does make everything blend together into a mass of sameness. The design diversity has been diminishing long enough. The users want change. The Android examples above just look boring in the most utilitarian way. Some would argue that that’s ok, that boring is good. But our lives are not about just accomplishing tasks on some to-do lists. We want to be delighted.\r\n\r\nThe new, skeuomorphic drive of all of these new trends also comes from the craft culture having a revival. Instead of another minimal, uninspiring IKEA table, we crave uneven wood that has a texture and a life for our homes. Same goes for wallets, backpacks, clothing, and more. We want the things we use to be “hand-crafted” rather than mass-produced.\r\n\r\nThe main problem with interfaces, however, is that they can’t really get too “funky”, or they’ll stop being functional. So how can we marry function with a form that looks beautiful and “organic”?\r\n\r\nYou know, just like the Northern Lights, which I think is a fitting name for this background type.\r\n\r\nIf the interface itself (the buttons, the fields, the labels) can’t really change that much, it’s up to the backgrounds to differentiate. This is the basic principle behind all the “morphisms” and this new Aurora style.\r\n\r\nUse the minimal design for everything that’s functional, and play around with ornamentation only. If done right, it also has the benefit of being accessible, because the actual interface — i.e. the things you use are accessible. So if someone can’t see some subtle background gradients, all they’d be missing is decoration.\r\n\r\nThis is also why I believe Neumorphism CAN be accessible if it’s just used for the cards and the cards have a proper hierarchy. Just don’t use it for text-fields, buttons and so on, and the contrast is going to be a non-issue.\r\n\r\nMixing “creative” backgrounds with minimal UI components is the best compromise between functionality and accessibility, but as with everything accessible it has to be done right.\r\n\r\n### Glassmorphism certified\r\n\r\nBefore we get to the backgrounds, it’s worth mentioning that this style works particularly well with Glassmorphism, and Apple knew it by creating a less blurred version of irregular color patterns as their main Big Sur wallpaper.\r\n\r\nApple and Microsoft are leading the way in exploring these new trends, but they’re not the only ones anymore.\r\n\r\n### How to start?\r\n\r\nYou can use your existing interface components with this style, as long as they have good enough contrasts, sizes and touch targets.\r\n\r\nThere are three main ways that you can use to create this effect.\r\n\r\n### Blurred shapes\r\n\r\nThe blurred shapes method is all about making irregular (preferably oval) shapes and then blurring them and mixing together to create an irregular gradient.\r\n\r\n### Multiple Gradient fills\r\n\r\nThis method is a mix of gradient fills (radial work best) with decreasing opacity towards the outer edge of the fill. Just drag the handles around to find the best mix. The more the transparent, outer-edge overlaps the more the colors will blend. You can also merge this method with the first one for something even more custom.\r\n",/n"Under normal circumstances, the majority of shows would take place within the grandiose setting of the Zaha Hadid–designed Dongdaemun Design Plaza which, while convenient, offers little room for designers to experiment with how their collections are presented. One silver lining to emerge this season, then, was the broader variety of backdrops, with designers exploring locations from the hallowed halls of the National Museum of Korea to the leafy environs of the Han Riverside Park, affording them the opportunity for more cohesive world-building alongside each collection. This mix of locations showcased more of what Seoul has to offer as a design capital, even from afar—something the week’s organizers would do well to continue with even when normality returns. \r\n\r\nThe highlights came by way of familiar faces such as the previously LVMH Prize-nominated Minju Kim, who showed off-schedule; more established Korean names like LIE; and a number of emerging talents, including Hanacha Studio and Painters. Together they made for an eclectic mix that reflects the rich patchwork of style scenes that have made Seoul a fashion capital.\r\n\r\nHere, find the five designers to know from Seoul Fashion Week’s fall 2021 season. \r\n\r\n##LIE\r\nAs one of the more established names on the Seoul Fashion Week schedule, designer Chung Chung Lee of LIE showed his collection in the colossal plaza outside the National Museum of Korea. It was a suitably epic setting for an outing that featured impeccably-cut and immediately desirable separates and outerwear. A number of particularly compelling pieces were inspired by horse riding, including a cropped, belted coat with a crossover shoulder detail and saddle-style leather bags dripping with tassels, buckles, and even stirrups. The most playful accessory? A riding crop. \r\n\r\n",/n"If you’re an Instagram user, you may have recently seen a pop-up asking if you want the service to “use your app and website activity” to “provide a better ads experience.” At the bottom there are two boxes: In a slightly darker shade of black than the pop-up background, you can choose to “Make ads less personalized.” A bright blue box urges users to “Make ads more personalized.”\r\n\r\nThis is an example of a dark pattern: design that manipulates or heavily influences users to make certain choices. Instagram uses terms like “activity” and “personalized” instead of “tracking” and “targeting,” so the user may not realize what they’re actually giving the app permission to do. Most people don’t want Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, to know everything they do and everywhere they go. But a “better experience” sounds like a good thing, so Instagram makes the option it wants users to select more prominent and attractive than the one it hopes they’ll avoid. \r\n\r\nThere’s now a growing movement to ban dark patterns, and that may well lead to consumer protection laws and action as the Biden administration’s technology policies and initiatives take shape. California is currently tackling dark patterns in its evolving privacy laws, and Washington state’s latest privacy bill includes a provision about dark patterns.\r\n\r\n“When you look at the way dark patterns are employed across digital engagement, generally, [the internet allows them to be] substantially exacerbated and made less visible to consumers,” Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, acting chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), told Recode. “Understanding the effect of that is really important to us as we craft our strategy for the digital economy.”\r\n\r\nDark patterns have for years been tricking internet users into giving up their data, money, and time. But if some advocates and regulators get their way, they may not be able to do that for much longer.\r\n### Dark patterns, briefly explained\r\n\r\nAlthough you may not have heard the term dark patterns before, you’ve surely seen countless examples of them — and experienced their effects:\r\n\r\n    The trial streaming service you signed up for, only to be automatically charged when the trial expired\r\n    The app interstitial ad you can’t figure out how to get out of because the “X” on the top right-hand corner is too small and faint to see ...\r\n    ... or the “X” is so small that you accidentally click on the ad itself and are redirected to the ad’s website\r\n    The drugstore account you have to create to get a vaccine appointment but can’t easily cancel\r\n    The marketing email that commands you to respond within the next five minutes or else, and includes a fake countdown timer\r\n    The big pop-up window urging you to sign up for a website’s newsletter with a big red “Sign Me Up” button, while the opt-out button is much smaller and passive-aggressively implies that anyone who clicks is a bad person who doesn’t care about saving money or staying informed\r\n\r\nBut there are also the effects that may not be as obvious. Dark patterns are used by websites to trick users into granting consent to being tracked, or having their data used in ways they didn’t expect and didn’t want. Or sites will claim they offer users ways to opt out of being tracked (usually because they legally have to do so), but use misleading language or make it especially difficult to actually do it.\r\n\r\nFor example: cookie consent pop-ups. Websites will tell you that their sites use cookies and then ask you to “accept” them, usually by clicking on a big, prominent, brightly colored icon. But if you want to refuse the cookies, you’ll have to search for and click through to a menu of settings and disable them manually. Most people don’t have the time or desire to do this for every single website they visit, if they even understand what’s being requested in the first place. Companies whose revenue relies heavily on user data don’t want to make it easy for those users to refuse to provide it.\r\n\r\nHarry Brignull coined the term “dark patterns” in 2010 and has been keeping tabs on them ever since on his website (he also wrote about them for The Verge back in 2013). Dark patterns existed in the physical world long before the internet came along: ’90s kids will remember the mail-order music club Columbia House’s amazing deal to buy 12 CDs for just one penny (plus shipping and handling), which then automatically opted them in to a CD-a-month club that was almost impossible to cancel. But the internet has made dark patterns so much more ubiquitous and powerful. Websites can refine their methods using the very specific feedback their visitors provide, optimizing their manipulation at a scale that the physical world could never in its wildest dreams achieve.\r\n\r\n“I think the internet has made it easier to industrialize the way in which we persuade and, in turn, manipulate and deceive each other,” Brignull told Recode.\r\n\r\nSome of the more obvious and scammy dark patterns — sneaking extra items into shopping baskets or tacking on hidden fees — have been made illegal in some places, and the FTC has gone after some of the most egregious offenders. But the law isn’t so cut and dried when it comes to privacy, data, and consent. \r\n\r\nIt’s hard to know what’s an actionable deceptive act or practice when there’s no privacy law in the first place. And it’s hard for consumers to know what they’re giving away unintentionally or how it might be used against them when it all happens behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n“It’s a bit like invisible health effects from breathing in fumes or getting a radiation dose: At the time, you might not realize it, but it has a hidden impact on you,” Brignull said. “With privacy, it’s quite difficult to think through and understand what the long-term implications are for you. You’re constantly leaking information about yourself to data brokers, and you don’t really know how they’re using it to market to you.”\r\n\r\nBecause of this, Brignull and a growing number of advocates, regulators, and lawmakers feel that legislation is necessary to stop these dark patterns so consumers can use the internet without constantly being manipulated into spending money, signing up for services they don’t need, or giving up their data.\r\n\r\n“Regulation works,” Brignull said. “It can really turn the internet into somewhere that’s nice to be instead of like a complete Wild West environment. And we need it.”\r\n### How laws and regulations can stop the worst dark patterns\r\n\r\nIf you live in California, you already have it. One of state Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s last acts before leaving office to run the Department of Health and Human Services was to add regulations around dark patterns to the state’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This banned dark patterns designed to make it difficult for consumers to exercise some of the rights that the law provides, like opting out of the sale of their data. Banned dark patterns include forcing users to click through multiple screens, scroll through lengthy privacy policies, urging them not to opt out, or using confusing language.\r\n\r\nWashington state’s third attempt to pass a privacy law, currently making its way through the legislature, says that dark patterns may not be used to obtain user consent to sell or share their data — a provision that was echoed in California’s recently passed Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), an expansion of its CCPA.\r\n\r\nFederal lawmakers are also paying attention to dark patterns. At a recent House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing about social media and disinformation, Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) asked Big Tech CEOs Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, and Jack Dorsey if they would oppose legislation that banned dark patterns that tricked users into giving away their data. This data, she said, was often used in algorithms that targeted people who are especially susceptible to misinformation.\r\n\r\n“Our children ... seniors, veterans, people of color, even our very democracy is at stake here,” Blunt Rochester said. “We must act. And we will assure you, we will act.”\r\n\r\nLate last year, the Congress member introduced the DETOUR (Deceptive Experience To Online Users Reduction) Act, the House version of the bill of the same name that Sens. Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Mark Warner (D-VA) introduced in 2019.\r\n\r\n“I introduced the DETOUR Act to address common tactics tech companies use that are used to get as much personal data as possible,” Blunt Rochester told Recode. “They are intentionally deceptive user interfaces that trick people into handing over their data.”\r\n\r\nThe bills target online services with more than 100 million monthly active users — Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, for example — and forbid them from designing user interfaces that manipulate users into consenting to give their personal data. The platforms also wouldn’t be able to run design change experiments on users without their consent.\r\n\r\nBlunt Rochester and Warner told Recode that they plan to reintroduce the DETOUR Act this session.\r\n\r\n“I’m committed to working with my colleagues in Congress to ban the use of these intentionally manipulative practices, designed to extract personal information from users,” Blunt Rochester said.\r\n\r\nSen. Fischer did not respond to a request for comment, but she rolled the DETOUR Act into the SAFE DATA Act, the Senate Commerce Committee Republicans’ version of a federal privacy law that they may reintroduce this session.\r\n\r\nFinally, the FTC, which would likely be in charge of regulating any legislation about dark patterns, is also taking a hard look at the practice.\r\n\r\n“This is a behavior we take seriously,” Slaughter, of the FTC, said.\r\n\r\nThe FTC plans to hold a workshop on the subject at the end of April, where it will discuss how dark patterns manipulate consumers, which groups may be especially vulnerable or harmed by this manipulation, what rules are in place to stop them, and if additional rules are needed and what they should be.\r\n\r\n“I think about this issue much more as one of data abuses than just data privacy,” Slaughter said. “The first step of collecting your data may not be the immediate harm. But how is that data then aggregated, used, transferred to manipulate your purchases, target advertising, create this surveillance economy that has a lot of downstream harms for users in a way that is less visible to the user or the public?”\r\n\r\nThe FTC’s authority here comes from its mandate to enforce laws against deceptive or unfair trade practices. The agency has gone after violators who use dark patterns where it can. Tricking people into signing up for and paying for subscriptions or services and intentionally making it difficult to cancel them is an obvious and actionable example. Making people think they’re buying something for a set price without making any additional charges clear is another one.\r\n\r\nOne of the few federal privacy laws we do have — the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act — gives the FTC authority over many privacy violations against children under 13, and many dark patterns are included in that law. But no such law exists for adults, so confusingly worded privacy policies and opt-outs that lead to data abuses may need legislation explicitly forbidding them before the FTC is empowered to act.\r\n\r\nThat legislation won’t be easy to write, either. The line between deliberate deception and legally urging a user to make a choice that materially benefits a company can be blurry.\r\n\r\n“Part of the challenge with regulating dark patterns are the gray areas: the instances where users of a technology are being constrained in such a way that they can’t exercise complete autonomy, but that they may not be experiencing full manipulation, or perhaps they are being coerced but with a light touch,” Jennifer King, privacy and data policy fellow at the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, told Recode.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of a federal privacy law, Slaughter says she hopes to use Section 18 of the FTC Act to exercise the commission’s rulemaking authority.\r\n\r\n“The FTC should have clearer, more direct Administrative Procedure Act rulemaking authority to address these kinds of things,” Slaughter said. “But in the meantime, I’m very excited to use all the tools that we have, including our Section 18 authority, to tackle it. Is it easy? No. Is it fast? No. Is it worth the effort? Yes. Because if we’re just waiting around for Congress to act, we could be waiting for a long time.” ",/n"Synthetic mRNA, the ingenious technology behind the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, might seem like a sudden breakthrough, or a new discovery. One year ago, almost nobody in the world knew what an mRNA vaccine was, for the good reason that no country in the world had ever approved one. Months later, the same technology powered the two fastest vaccine trials in the history of science.\r\n\r\nLike so many breakthroughs, this apparent overnight success was many decades in the making. More than 40 years had passed between the 1970s, when a Hungarian scientist pioneered early mRNA research, and the day the first authorized mRNA vaccine was administered in the United States, on December 14, 2020. In the interim, the idea’s long road to viability nearly destroyed several careers and almost bankrupted several companies.\r\n\r\nThe dream of mRNA persevered in part because its core principle was tantalizingly simple, even beautiful: The world’s most powerful drug factory might be inside all of us.\r\n\r\nRead: 3 ways the pandemic has made the world better\r\n\r\nPeople rely on proteins for just about every bodily function; mRNA—which stands for messenger ribonucleic acid—tells our cells which proteins to make. With human-edited mRNA, we could theoretically commandeer our cellular machinery to make just about any protein under the sun. You could mass-produce molecules that occur naturally in the body to repair organs or improve blood flow. Or you could request our cells to cook up an off-menu protein, which our immune system would learn to identify as an invader and destroy.\r\nIn the case of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, mRNA vaccines send detailed instructions to our cells to make its distinctive “spike protein.” Our immune system, seeing the foreign intruder, targets these proteins for destruction without disabling the mRNA. Later, if we confront the full virus, our bodies recognize the spike protein again and attack it with the precision of a well-trained military, reducing the risk of infection and blocking severe illness.\r\n\r\nBut mRNA’s story likely will not end with COVID-19: Its potential stretches far beyond this pandemic. This year, a team at Yale patented a similar RNA-based technology to vaccinate against malaria, perhaps the world’s most devastating disease. Because mRNA is so easy to edit, Pfizer says that it is planning to use it against seasonal flu, which mutates constantly and kills hundreds of thousands of people around the world every year. The company that partnered with Pfizer last year, BioNTech, is developing individualized therapies that would create on-demand proteins associated with specific tumors to teach the body to fight off advanced cancer. In mouse trials, synthetic-mRNA therapies have been shown to slow and reverse the effects of multiple sclerosis. “I’m fully convinced now even more than before that mRNA can be broadly transformational,” Özlem Türeci, BioNTech’s chief medical officer, told me. “In principle, everything you can do with protein can be substituted by mRNA.”\r\n\r\nIn principle is the billion-dollar asterisk. mRNA’s promise ranges from the expensive-yet-experimental to the glorious-yet-speculative. But the past year was a reminder that scientific progress may happen suddenly, after long periods of gestation. “This has been a coming-out party for mRNA, for sure,” says John Mascola, the director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “In the world of science, RNA technology could be the biggest story of the year. We didn’t know if it worked. And now we do.”\r\n1. The Long Road to Breakthrough\r\n\r\nFor more than 40 years, synthetic RNA couldn’t do anything useful. In 1978, Katalin Karikó was a young scientist at the Biological Research Centre in Szeged, Hungary, when she started working on the idea that it could. She left Hungary for the U.S. in the 1980s. At the University of Pennsylvania, she still struggled to design mRNA that the body did not immediately reject. When her research failed to attract the support of government grants and university colleagues, she was demoted.\r\n\r\nAfter a decade of fits and starts, Karikó and her research partner Drew Weissman finally broke through in the early 2000s. To sneak synthetic mRNA past the cell’s defenses, they realized that they had to tweak one of its molecular building blocks, the nucleosides that comprise a strand of RNA. “The solution, Karikó and Weissman discovered, was the biological equivalent of swapping out a tire,” the journalists Damian Garde and Jonathan Saltzman wrote for the science website Stat.\r\n\r\nGraeme Wood and David A. Spiegel: COVID-19 vaccines are coming, but they’re not what you think\r\n\r\nIn the U.S., the paper caught the attention of a brash group of postdoctoral researchers, professors, and venture capitalists. They started a company whose name smushed the words modified and RNA: Moderna. In Germany, Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, a married couple with a background in immunotherapy research, also saw huge potential. They founded several companies, including one to research mRNA-based treatments for cancer: BioNTech.\r\n\r\n“There was a lot of skepticism in the industry when we started, because this was a new technology with no approved products,” Türeci told me. “Drug development is highly regulated, so people don’t like to deviate from paths with which they have experience.” BioNTech and Moderna pressed on for years without approved products, thanks to the support of philanthropists, investors, and other companies. Moderna partnered with the NIH and received tens of millions of dollars from DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, to develop vaccines against viruses, including Zika. In 2018, Pfizer signed a deal with BioNTech to develop mRNA vaccines for the flu.\r\n\r\n“The technology initially appealed to us for the flu because of its great speed and flexibility,” Philip Dormitzer, who leads Pfizer’s viral-vaccines research and development programs, told me. “You can edit mRNA very quickly. That is quite useful for a virus like the flu, which requires two updated vaccines each year, for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.”\r\n\r\nBy the time the coronavirus outbreak shut down the city of Wuhan, China, Moderna and BioNTech had spent years fine-tuning their technology. When the outbreak spread throughout the world, Pfizer and BioNTech were prepared to shift immediately and redirect their flu research toward SARS-CoV-2. “It was really a case of our researchers swapping the flu protein for the coronavirus spike protein,” Dormitzer said. “It turned out that it wasn’t that big a leap.”\r\n\r\nArmed with years of mRNA clinical work that built on decades of basic research, scientists solved the mystery of SARS-CoV-2 with astonishing speed. On January 11, 2020, Chinese researchers published the genetic sequence of the virus. Moderna’s mRNA vaccine recipe was finalized in about 48 hours. By late February, batches of the vaccine had been shipped to Bethesda, Maryland, for clinical trials. Its development was accelerated by the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed, which invested billions of dollars in several vaccine candidates, including Moderna’s. With the perfect timing of a Hollywood epic, mRNA entered the promised land after about 40 wandering years of research. Scientific progress had proceeded at its typical two-speed pace—slowly, slowly, then all at once.\r\n2. Faster, Faster!\r\n\r\nSpeed and nimbleness were the qualities that first interested both DARPA and Pfizer in mRNA. And if the technology unlocks more breakthroughs after this pandemic, speed and nimbleness will play starring roles.\r\n\r\nMalaria kills more than 400,000 people every year, mostly young children. It is not caused by a virus or bacteria, but rather by an organism belonging to a separate phylum, called plasmodium. Plasmodia have a host of shape-shifting strategies to evade our immune systems. With most diseases, you catch it once and develop some protection going forward. But malaria shakes off our cellular defenses, making it possible to catch the disease over and over again. That also makes malaria hard to inoculate against: The only existing vaccine doesn’t work very well, even after a four-shot regimen.\r\n\r\nFrom the January/February 2021 issue: How science beat the virus\r\n\r\nLast month, a patent was approved for an RNA-based vaccine against malaria that showed promise in mice. “We’ve been working on this vaccine for years, but the entire landscape has changed in the last six months because of the success of COVID vaccines,” Richard Bucala, the vaccine’s co-inventor and a scientist at the Yale School of Medicine, told me.\r\n\r\nThe malaria vaccine uses self-amplifying RNA, or saRNA, which is subtly distinct from the mRNA technology used by Moderna and Pfizer. The vaccines against COVID-19 work by injecting up front all of the messenger RNA that you’re going to get. But self-amplifying RNA is designed to replicate itself inside our cells. This copy-paste function means, in theory, that each person needs only a tiny dose of vaccine to have a large immune response.\r\n\r\n“The replication function of saRNA is critical, because it’s not vaccines that prevent infection but vaccinations that prevent infection,” Bucala said. A miracle drug that’s not administered is no better than a worthless medicine that’s never approved. “The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines need a lot of mRNA, and it’s expensive to make, which is why it’s been slower to get to many countries outside the U.S.,” he went on. “With saRNA, we could inject one-hundredth of the material to have the same effect. That would make it easier to scale against a widespread disease.”\r\n\r\nThen there’s cancer. Scientists may never devise a single vaccine for cancer, because cancer is not a single disease but a constellation of more than 100 maladies, which we usually name for the place on the body where they originate. But what if we could respond to these hundreds of cancers with our own constellation of therapies that could train the body to attack a specific tumor?\r\n\r\nThis is the idea behind BioNTech’s cancer-immunotherapy research. It works something like this: For each cancer patient, BioNTech takes a tissue sample from a tumor to perform a genetic analysis. Based on that test, the company designs an individually tailored mRNA vaccine, which tells the patient’s cells to produce proteins associated with that specific tumor’s specific mutation. The immune system learns to search-and-destroy similar tumor cells throughout the body.\r\n\r\nThis cycle of analysis and design is not so different from the way BioNTech and Moderna swiftly analyzed Chinese scientists’ sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, identified the spike protein for attack, and made an effective therapy. “We hope that everything we’ve learned from COVID about producing and manufacturing mRNA can cross-fertilize the work on our off-the-shelf cancer treatments,” BioNTech’s Özlem Türeci told me. The company is currently in clinical trials for personalized vaccines in “basically every solid cancer,” she said, including melanoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. A 2021 analysis by University of North Carolina researchers in the journal Molecular Cancer pointed out that these cancer treatments have been slow to develop in recent years but that the COVID-19 breakthrough coincided with “promising” clinical trials in cancer vaccines. “We envision the rapid advancing of mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy in the near future,” they concluded.\r\n3. We Make Our Own Luck\r\n\r\nIn March 2020, Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine, didn’t think that mRNA technology would win the race against COVID-19. His bet was on the pharmaceutical company Merck, which had recently developed an astonishingly successful vaccine against Ebola using a modified livestock virus called vesicular stomatitis virus, or VSV. But Merck discontinued its COVID-19 vaccines when its promising new technology failed in clinical trials.\r\n\r\nHotez sees Merck’s failures as a critical lesson about science—and a cautionary tale about mRNA.“The technology that works for one epidemic might not work for the next one, and you won’t know what works until you try it,” he told me. “That’s why I say it’s too soon to call mRNA vaccines a miracle. They might not work against the next target.”\r\n\r\nEven mRNA’s biggest proponents concede the point. “This is not a magic bullet, and it’s not perfect for everything,” Pfizer’s Dormitzer told me. His partners at BioNTech concurred. “I do not claim that mRNA is the holy grail for everything,” Türeci said. “We are going to find that there are diseases where mRNA is surprisingly successful and diseases where it’s not. We have to prove it for each and every infectious disease, one by one.”\r\n\r\nmRNA may not produce a great second act in the next decade, or ever. Perhaps the scientific establishment will conclude that the technology benefited in the pandemic from a uniquely simple nemesis. “The coronavirus might be one of the easiest vaccine targets we’ve seen in modern times,” Hotez agreed. “Just about everything we’ve thrown at it has worked.”\r\n\r\nMaybe we got lucky. But luck is downstream from preparation. The coronavirus was an easy target only because science made it easy. Four years ago, following the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Arabian Peninsula and South Korea, 18 scientists from the NIH, Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College, and other institutions published a detailed examination of the shape and behavior of the coronavirus’s most notable feature: the spike protein. This paper decoded the mysteries and vulnerabilities of the virus long before anybody knew that this tiny pathogen would soon shut down the world. “Our studies,” they presciently concluded in their 2017 paper, “provide a foundation for the structure-based design of coronavirus vaccines.” Without this detective work, the mRNA breakthrough might not have happened.\r\n\r\nToday’s vaccines were forged from science’s successes, but also from its failures. For decades, researchers have struggled to design a workable vaccine for HIV, and many observers considered this field a dead end. But a new paper argues that these repeated failures forced HIV-vaccine researchers to spend a lot of time and money on strange and unproven vaccine techniques—such as synthetic mRNA and the viral-vector technology that powers the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Nearly 90 percent of COVID-19 vaccines that made it to clinical trials used technology that “could be traced back to prototypes tested in HIV vaccine trials,” Jeffrey E. Harris, the economist at MIT who authored the paper, wrote. He points out that if one HIV vaccine had succeeded, the company behind it would have won big. Instead, all of the competitors in the vaccine field learned from collective failure and contributed to collective wisdom. The many false starts of HIV vaccination sired an explosion of new technologies and helped usher in a possible new golden age of vaccines.\r\n4. The Tree of Progress\r\n\r\nWe can call our record-breaking vaccine-development process good luck. Or we can call it what it really is: a ringing endorsement for the essential role of science in the world.\r\n\r\n“Five years ago, we were in a state of ignorance about mRNA,” Mascola, of the NIH, told me. “And five years from now, we will learn that we are, at this very moment, in another state of ignorance. That’s why mRNA is such a beautiful scientific story. So many researchers, philanthropists, government organizations, and companies took a huge risk on a technology whose initial responses were marginal. And together, they figured out how to make it work.”\r\n\r\nAs a parable of scientific progress, I sometimes imagine the life cycle of a tree. Basic scientific research plants a variety of seeds. Some of these seeds fail entirely; the research goes nowhere. Some seeds become tiny shrubs; the research doesn’t fail entirely, but it produces little of value. And some seeds blossom into towering trees with abundant fruit that scientists, companies, and technologists pluck and turn into the products that change our lives. For years, mRNA technology looked like a shrub. In 2020, it blossomed in full view.\r\n\r\nYou cannot know in the early stages whether you’re planting a dud or a revolution. Even if it is a revolution, you cannot know what kind. Pfizer jumped into mRNA research for its potential to work against influenza, only to make history fighting a completely different virus. But this uncertainty risk is exactly why countries like the U.S. ought to encourage more basic science and highly novel research.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of mRNA, from backwater research to breakthrough technology, is not a hero’s journey, but a heroes’ journey. Without Katalin Karikó’s grueling efforts to make mRNA technology work, the world would have no Moderna or BioNTech. Without government funding and philanthropy, both companies might have gone bankrupt before their 2020 vaccines. Without the failures in HIV-vaccine research forcing scientists to trailblaze in strange new fields, we might still be in the dark about how to make the technology work. Without an international team of scientists unlocking the secrets of the coronavirus’s spike protein several years ago, we might not have known enough about this pathogen to design a vaccine to defeat it last year. mRNA technology was born of many seeds.",/n"There’s a growing argument, coming mostly from the left, that President Joe Biden’s foreign policy is essentially the same as former President Donald Trump’s.\r\n\r\nIt goes something like this: Two months into his administration, Biden is pursuing many of the same objectives as his predecessor. Sure, the tone has changed — namely, talk of rebuilding alliances and defending democracy and human rights — but much of the substance remains the same.\r\n\r\nFor example, Biden has taken an adversarial stance toward China and Russia; sold billions in weapons to a dictator in Egypt; kept the economic sanctions Trump imposed on Iran and the International Criminal Court (ICC) in place; declined to sanction Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his role in ordering the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi; and is unlikely to drastically slash the Pentagon budget.\r\n\r\nIn effect, they argue that US foreign policy right now is Trump’s with Bidenesque characteristics.\r\n\r\nThat critique is coming from a small but vocal chorus of analysts, activists, and noted commentators like Noam Chomsky. Stephen Miles, executive director of the progressive foreign policy group Win Without War, recently told Politico that “There’s this fear of being attacked on the right of not being tough enough on China or Iran or other issues.” The problem, he adds, is “there doesn’t seem to be as much concern about the overwhelming majority of the Democratic Party.”\r\n\r\nIt’s a provocative case, but it’s not very convincing. While there are some similarities between the two presidents, Biden and Trump have extremely different foreign policies. Any claims that they’re the same are incomplete at best.\r\n### The case for Biden’s foreign policy as the same as Trump’s, briefly explained\r\n\r\nIn December, I wrote a story about how Biden wanted the US to pursue a traditional, post-World War II foreign policy to defend the “liberal international order” — essentially the diplomatic and economic rules and norms that run the world. As Biden formed a team to do just that, progressives I interviewed couldn’t mask their displeasure.\r\n\r\n“Americans are looking for a complete, fundamental shift in US foreign policy,” Yasmine Taeb, a senior fellow at the progressive Center for International Policy who’s leading the left’s critique of Biden’s team, told me at the time. “I hope they recognize that the vast majority of the American people have rejected establishment foreign policy and the trajectory that we’ve been on for decades.”\r\n\r\nNow, Taeb and others are essentially saying, “I told you so.” They argue that two months into Biden’s presidency, it’s clear that “complete, fundamental shift in US foreign policy” hasn’t happened yet. What Americans have gotten instead is a Biden foreign policy that echoes Trump’s more than progressive critics like.\r\n\r\nTake Biden selling $200 million in missiles to Egypt, a country led by a dictator who has routinely violated human rights, jailing thousands of political dissidents and killing hundreds more. Biden’s detractors compare that to Trump’s decision to sell $8 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, even after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the 2018 murder of US resident Jamal Khashoggi.\r\n\r\nThey also point out that Biden’s team hasn’t lifted sanctions the Trump administration placed on the ICC. Trump took that action because the ICC was considering opening two investigations: one into alleged war crimes committed by US troops during the Afghanistan war, and one into alleged war crimes committed by Israelis and Palestinians during the 2014 Gaza War; the court was also considering making a determination on whether Israeli settlements in the West Bank constitute a war crime.\r\n\r\nTwo months in, Biden’s team has kept those sanctions in place. It’s not exactly clear why; when asked by reporters, the administration usually declines to comment. But Axios and the Guardian last month noted that Jerusalem is lobbying allies, including the US, to keep the financial pressure on the court in hopes that it will drop the case.\r\n\r\nThat rationale — that the Biden administration is keeping Trump’s sanctions on partly at Israel’s behest — tracks with comments some US officials have made.\r\n\r\n“We have serious concerns about the ICC’s attempts to exercise its jurisdiction over Israeli personnel,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a February statement. “The United States has always taken the position that the court’s jurisdiction should be reserved for countries that consent to it, or that are referred by the UN Security Council.”\r\n\r\nFor these and the other reasons cited above, critics say Biden’s foreign policy represents more continuity than change from the Trump years. That seems fair on the surface, but the truth is Biden’s foreign policy is nothing like Trump’s. Not even close.\r\nBiden and Trump are “a bit different” on foreign policy\r\n\r\n### Consider either what Biden has done or has said he wants to do on foreign policy:\r\n\r\n-    He rejoined the Paris climate agreement after Trump pulled the US out of it, and has made tackling climate change a top priority.\r\n-    He made the US a member of Covax, the global effort to fund and deliver Covid-19 vaccines around the world, which Trump didn’t do.\r\n-    He ended the “Muslim ban” that Trump put in place.\r\n-    He reversed Trump’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO).\r\n-    He ordered the US to rejoin the United Nations Human Rights Council after Trump took America out of it.\r\n-    He immediately extended the New START arms control pact with Russia for the maximum of five years, which the Trump administration didn’t want to do outright.\r\n-    He lifted the “foreign terrorist organization” designation off Yemen’s Houthis that the Trump administration imposed.\r\n-    He ended America’s support for offensive operations in the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\r\n-    He declined to make summitry with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un the centerpiece of his diplomatic strategy; Trump met with the dictator three times.\r\n-    He repeatedly expressed a desire to get the US back into the Iran nuclear deal after Trump withdrew the US from the pact.\r\n\r\nThere’s more, but it’s already notable that Biden and Trump just don’t see the world the same way. \r\n\r\nWhat’s more, Biden’s different tone — defending democracy and supporting human rights, among other things — is in itself a substantive policy change from the Trump years.\r\n\r\n“I made it clear that no American president [should] ever back down from speaking out of what’s happening to the Uyghurs, what’s happening in Hong Kong, what’s happening in-country,” Biden said during a press conference last week about his conversations with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\r\n\r\n“The moment a president walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world,” he continued. “It’s who we are.”\r\n\r\nBiden has followed through on his rhetoric by sanctioning Chinese officials for human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang and for cracking down on Hong Kong’s democracy.\r\n\r\nBut don’t take it from me or Biden. Trump administration officials also note the wide gap between the current president’s positions and the old one’s.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the list above didn’t just come from my head. It came from conversations with Trump-era staff who said US foreign policy would be “a bit different,” according to one, if the Republican had won a second term.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, they said the US wouldn’t have extended New START for five years, rejoined the WHO, lifted the terrorist label on the Houthis, or pushed for a return to the UN Human Rights Council.\r\n\r\nAnd already former Trump administration officials, like then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, are blasting Biden for pursuing a foreign policy built around defending democracy and human rights instead of pure national interests.\r\n\r\n“The central theme of President Biden’s foreign policy is a global, muscular liberalism,” he wrote in the Washington Post last week. “But it is not a sensible policy today,” he wrote, partly because the US is no longer the unquestioned global power.\r\n\r\nWhile he didn’t specifically mention Trump in the piece, he argued the more economic-focused course Trump took — “making sure we can determine our future free of external coercion and being able to trade and invest overseas on terms that promote a broad-based national prosperity” — would be better.\r\n\r\nSo no, Biden’s foreign policy isn’t nearly the same as Trump’s. But the meme persists, it seems, mostly because Biden has yet to return the US to the Iran nuclear deal.\r\n### How the Iran nuclear deal keeps the myth of Biden-as-Trump alive\r\n\r\nThose who argue Biden is pursuing a Trump-like foreign policy have one overriding complaint: that Biden hasn’t lifted Trump-imposed sanctions on Iran as a way to return swiftly to the nuclear pact — a decision praised by Jared Kushner, Trump’s senior adviser and son in law.\r\n\r\nBut Biden’s team says the situation isn’t as simple as progressives and Iran doves make it out to be. Tehran is in violation of the agreement, namely by enriching uranium at levels beyond caps outlined in the deal. Until the US can verify Iran has come back into compliance, there’s no reason to remove the economic leverage America has.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Biden’s team feels they inherited a bad situation. After Trump withdrew the US from the pact in 2018, Iran decided to violate the deal as a way to pressure the US back into the accord. Dropping the sanctions now, some in the new administration would say, rewards Tehran for no longer abiding by the nuclear deal’s terms.\r\n\r\nHence the delay. The US would “have to evaluate whether they were actually making good if they say they are coming back into compliance with their obligations, and then we would take it from there,” Secretary of State Tony Blinken said in his January confirmation hearing.\r\n\r\nBut even here there’s a yawning gap between how Trump and Biden handle the issue. The Trump administration wanted Iran to change nearly every aspect of its foreign policy before winning sanctions relief. Biden just wants Iran to abide by the nuclear pact again, and has even proposed partial sanctions removal for partial compliance.\r\n\r\nRyan Tully, who served as a top official on Trump’s National Security Council, confirmed his team would’ve pursued a different course. “We wouldn’t give sanctions relief to get to the negotiating table with Iran,” he told me.\r\n\r\nThe US may not be back in the nuclear deal, then, but it’s at least trying to get there. “Biden is offering Tehran a way out that doesn’t involve either its capitulation or collapse,” said Henry Rome, an expert on US policy toward Iran at the Eurasia Group consulting firm. “It’s a very different ballgame.”\r\n\r\n“A very different ballgame” goes not only for Biden’s Iran policy, but his entire foreign policy. There are clearly some similarities between the last two administrations — it’s been only two months, after all — but overall, they are vastly different.",/n"A blog (a truncation of \"weblog\")[1] is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual,[citation needed] occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, \"multi-author blogs\" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other \"microblogging\" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.\r\n\r\nThe emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer programming. Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. In the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.[2] In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.[3] However, there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.\r\n\r\nMany blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from philosophy, religion, and arts to science, politics, and sports. Others function as more personal online diaries or online brand advertising of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, digital images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. The ability of readers to leave publicly viewable comments, and interact with other commenters, is an important contribution to the popularity of many blogs. However, blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (art blogs), photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs or \"vlogs\"), music (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts). In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to as edublogs. Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.\r\n\r\n'Blog' and 'blogging' are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on social media, especially when the content is long-form and one creates and shares content on regular basis. So, one could be maintaining a blog on Facebook or blogging on Instagram.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, 2011, there were over 156 million public blogs in existence. On February 20, 2014, there were around 172 million Tumblr[4] and 75.8 million WordPress[5] blogs in existence worldwide. According to critics and other bloggers, Blogger is the most popular blogging service used today. However, Blogger does not offer public statistics.[6][7] Technorati lists 1.3 million blogs as of February 22, 2014.[8] ",/n"Lei Jun’s plan to join the increasingly crowded field of electric vehicle builders in China drew a muted reaction from the market on Wednesday as some analysts warned of the risks that lie ahead.\r\n\r\nShares of Lei’s smartphone maker Xiaomi finished the day with a modest gain of 0.6%, after the company said Tuesday evening that it plans to invest about $10 billion into manufacturing electric cars over the next decade. Lei said Xiaomi would pursue the plan through a wholly owned subsidiary, which he described as his last major startup project.\r\n\r\n“I will personally oversee this [EV business],” the billionaire said. “I look forward to the future where there is a Xiaomi car running on every road globally.”\r\n\r\nThe company’s news release effectively confirms a rumor about a possible EV venture that had surfaced earlier this year. Xiaomi’s core business is selling smartphones, more than 60% of last year’s 245.9 billion yuan ($37.4 billion) came from its phone unit. But the market for smartphones has been shrinking. Market research firm Canalys says smartphone shipments worldwide stood at 1.26 billion units in 2020, down 7% from a year earlier partly due to the impact of the pandemic.\r\n\r\n\r\nXiaomi Celebrates 10th Anniversary In Beijing\r\n\r\nXiaomi CEO Lei Jun gives a public speech for Xiaomi's 10th anniversary on August 11, 2020 in ...

Xiaomi’s core business is selling smartphones, more than 60% of last year’s 245.9 billion yuan ($37.4 billion) came from its phone unit. But the market for smartphones has been shrinking. Market research firm Canalys says smartphone shipments worldwide stood at 1.26 billion units in 2020, down 7% from a year earlier partly due to the impact of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nXiaomi is currently the world’s fourth-largest smartphone maker with a market share of 12%, Canalys data shows. Lei, who derives the majority of his wealth from his stake in the company, has a net worth of $24 billion, making him the 13th richest person in China, according to Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaire’s List. Aside from a shrinking market, the billionaire also recently had to tangle with the U.S. government. A federal judge in March ordered a temporary halt to a U.S government ban that blocked Americans from investing in the company, which had sent Xiaomi shares plunging 10% when it was announced in January.\r\n\r\nAnalysts say electric cars could present a new growth opportunity. Chinese consumers are increasingly attracted by the sleekly designed models, which often have autonomous driving features and can be remotely controlled to stream music or video via in-car displays. This year, China’s sales of electric vehicles is expected to climb to 1.9 million units, a jump of 51% from a year earlier, according to Canalys. \r\n\r\n“Internet companies may think they have an advantage because cars are getting increasingly intelligent, and are being compared to computers on four wheels,” says Yale Zhang, an analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. “But making cars is a huge risk, and nobody knows whether Xiaomi’s venture will be successful or not.”\r\n\r\nZhang pointed to the boom-to-bust cycle that China’s EV market experienced just a couple years ago, when hundreds of startups had been seeking to gain a foothold in a growing market. But as government subsidies were phased out and funding dried up, only a handful managed to survive.\r\n\r\nLei said on Tuesday that he made the decision to venture into EVs after careful evaluation and research that began in mid-January. “We are fully aware of the risks involved,” he said. “We are also aware the project will require billions in investment, and likely take at least 3-5 years before we see any return.\"\r\n\r\nA Xiaomi spokesperson said the company had no additional comment at this stage, including how it would manufacture the cars and when it would launch the first model. The company had previously dismissed via China’s Twitter-equivalent Sina Weibo reports that it would make cars using Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor’s factory.\r\n\r\nLei had previously dabbled in the EV industry. Shunwei Capital, a venture capital firm he cofounded in 2011, counts Chinese electric car companies Nio and Xpeng among its portfolio, according to its website. It also invested in Momenta, an autonomous driving startup that had a valuation of $1 billion after a 2018 funding round.",/n"# Backend Architecture\r\n\r\nSoftware engineers seem to always be discussing the front-end and the backend of their apps. But what exactly does this mean?\r\n\r\nThe front-end is the code that is executed on the client side. This code (typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) runs in the user’s browser and creates the user interface.\r\n\r\nThe backend is the code that runs on the server, that receives requests from the clients, and contains the logic to send the appropriate data back to the client. The backend also includes the database, which will persistently store all of the data for the application. This article focuses on the hardware and software on the server-side that make this possible.\r\n\r\nReview HTTP and REST if you want to refresh your memory on these topics. These are the main conventions that provide structure to the request-response cycle between clients and servers.\r\n\r\nLet’s start by reviewing the client-server relationship, and then we can start to put the pieces all together!\r\n### What are the clients?\r\n\r\nThe clients are anything that send requests to the backend. They are often browsers that make requests for the HTML and JavaScript code that they will execute to display websites to the end user. However, there are many different kinds of clients: they might be a mobile application, an application running on another server, or even a web enabled smart appliance.\r\n### What is a backend?\r\n\r\nThe backend is all of the technology required to process the incoming request and generate and send the response to the client. This typically includes three major parts:\r\n\r\n    The server. This is the computer that receives requests.\r\n    The app. This is the application running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from the database, and sends a response.\r\n    The database. Databases are used to organize and persist data.\r\n\r\n### What is a server?\r\n\r\nA server is simply a computer that listens for incoming requests. Though there are machines made and optimized for this particular purpose, any computer that is connected to a network can act as a server. In fact, you will often use your very own computer as server when developing apps.\r\nWhat are the core functions of the app?\r\n\r\nThe server runs an app that contains logic about how to respond to various requests based on the HTTP verb and the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The pair of an HTTP verb and a URI is called a route and matching them based on a request is called routing.\r\n\r\nSome of these handler functions will be middleware. In this context, middleware is any code that executes between the server receiving a request and sending a response. These middleware functions might modify the request object, query the database, or otherwise process the incoming request. Middleware functions typically end by passing control to the next middleware function, rather than by sending a response.\r\n\r\nEventually, a middleware function will be called that ends the request-response cycle by sending an HTTP response back to the client.\r\n\r\nOften, programmers will use a framework like Express or Ruby on Rails to simplify the logic of routing. For now, just think that each route can have one or many handler functions that are executed whenever a request to that route (HTTP verb and URI) is matched.\r\nWhat kinds of responses can a server send?\r\n\r\nThe data that the server sends back can come in different forms. For example, a server might serve up an HTML file, send data as JSON, or it might send back only an HTTP status code. You’ve probably seen the status code “404 - Not Found” whenever you’ve tried navigating to a URI that doesn’t exist, but there are many more status codes that indicate what happened when the server received the request.\r\n### What is a database, and why do we need to use them?\r\n\r\nDatabases are commonly used on the backend of web applications. These databases provide an interface to save data in a persistent way to memory. Storing the data in a database both reduces the load on the main memory of the server CPU and allows the data to be retrieved if the server crashes or loses power.\r\n\r\nMany requests sent to the server might require a database query. A client might request information that is stored in the database, or a client might submit data with their request to be added to the database.",/n"# Algorithm, Design and Analysis [Asymptomatic Notations]\r\n\r\n#### What is an algorithm?\r\n\r\nIt's a finite set of steps to solve a problem.\r\n\r\nTwo types:\r\n- Priori : Analysis done before execution\r\n- Prosteriori : Analysis done after execution\r\n\r\n#### Asymptomatic Notations\r\n- Big O (worst case)\r\n- Big Omega (best case)\r\n- Theta (average case)\r\n\r\nSo every function can be written/represented in these big O, Big omega, theta notations.\r\n\r\n##### BIG O Eg:\r\nf(n)= 2n<sup>2</sup> + 2\r\n\t\twhich is lesser than equal to \t\t\tc.g(n<sup>2</sup>)\r\nYou gotta put in the higher exponential function, i.e, the **n<sup>2</sup>**.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow for the second part, it's obvious, **2n<sup>2</sup> + n** is obvio gonna be  more than just *2n<sup>2</sup>* but less than **2n<sup>2</sup>**\r\n\r\n##### BIG Omega Eg:\r\n\r\n\r\n|||<sup>ly</sup> the same applies to this example. \r\n\r\n##### BIG Theta Eg:\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah you get it\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## Their Various Properties:\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall O : use n<sup>3</sup>\r\nSmall Omega : use n\r\n\r\n",/n
